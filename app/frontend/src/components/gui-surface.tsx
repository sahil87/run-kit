/**
 * GuiSurface — the renderer for the `gui` lens (spec docs/specs/gui.md § The
 * substrate / § Availability vs reachability), mounted as a tile by
 * SurfaceLayout's `case "gui"` and lazy-loaded (`export default` +
 * `React.lazy`) so tabs that never open a gui tile never pay for noVNC.
 *
 * - **Content states**: `enabled && reachable` mounts a noVNC `RFB` on a bare
 *   host div connected to the ABSOLUTE `ws(s)://<location.host>/ws/gui/host`
 *   URL (never a relative path — the embed must work behind any proxy); an
 *   enabled-but-unreachable host renders the empty state with the `reason`
 *   fetched ONCE per unreachable transition (never polled — the state socket
 *   drives re-fetch). A `!enabled` host never mounts this tile (degradation).
 *   On a reachable host with NO window manager (`wm === ""`, never on the
 *   screen-sharing mirror backend) a one-line strip (`gui-wm-strip`) rides
 *   above the canvas as a flex sibling — the fit subtracts it — carrying the
 *   status document's `wm_hint` install line (fetched ONCE per bare
 *   transition, the reason-fetch grammar), a Copy of the line, the empty
 *   state's Restart supervisor action, and a per-viewer dismiss
 *   (`runkit-gui-wm-strip-dismissed`, cleared whenever `wm` turns non-empty).
 * - **Connection lifecycle**: connect/disconnect report through
 *   `onConnectionChange` (the top-bar dot). An RFB disconnect while
 *   `reachable` stays true re-dials on a 1s→2s→4s→8s backoff (reset on
 *   connect) under a `disconnected — reconnecting…` overlay; `reachable`
 *   flipping false swaps in the empty state and clears the timer. When the
 *   tile is not VISIBLE (zoomed away, or the document hidden) for 15s the RFB
 *   disconnects — releasing the relay's viewer count so the backend probe
 *   resumes — and reconnects on the next visible true. Focus loss alone never
 *   disconnects. Unmount disconnects and clears every timer.
 * - **Resize policy (D7)**: `resizeSession` is `!coarsePointer && focused &&
 *   !resizeLocked && !hostLocked && geometry === "auto"`, recomputed on every
 *   prop change. D7's follow-the-tile is now the `auto` value of the host's
 *   `gui.geometry` setting: only while it reads `auto` may the focused
 *   fine-pointer viewer drive SetDesktopSize; a fixed `WxH` (or the `""` of a
 *   disabled host) disables `resizeSession` for EVERY viewer, so the desktop
 *   keeps its configured size (fit mode already letterboxes via
 *   `scaleViewport`). Under `auto` the two pins keep their meaning:
 *   `hostLocked` is the host-side pin (`rk gui lock`, streamed as the entry's
 *   `locked`) — an AND term beside the viewer-local `resizeLocked`, not a
 *   replacement. Coarse viewers scale client-side only and can never resize
 *   the shared desktop.
 * - **Zoom (the sized host)**: `scaleViewport` stays ON at every zoom and
 *   `clipViewport` off; a percentage zoom sizes the noVNC host div to
 *   `fb × z/100` CSS px (the framebuffer from the gui signal's width/height)
 *   so noVNC's autoscale yields exactly z/100 and `_display.scale` equals the
 *   canvas's visual scale by construction (pointer mapping stays exact). At
 *   `fit` the host div is tile-sized, today's behavior. While zoomed
 *   `resizeSession` is held false: noVNC's ResizeObserver watches that screen
 *   div, and its deliberately-larger size must never be requested as the
 *   remote desktop size (the gui-signal echo would feed back and grow the
 *   framebuffer unboundedly); the five-clause formula is untouched and
 *   resumes at `fit`.
 * - **Pan**: the wrapper clips (`overflow: hidden`) and pans via clamped
 *   scroll offsets so the scaled canvas always covers the tile. A fine
 *   pointer left-drag pans — the press is swallowed in the capture phase so
 *   it never reaches noVNC as a guest button, and a release under
 *   PAN_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX is replayed to the canvas as a plain click. A
 *   coarse one-finger drag in `touch` mode pans via an observing (passive,
 *   capture-phase) touch tracker while `dragViewport` keeps noVNC from
 *   sending the drag to the guest as a left-drag — noVNC's own viewport pan
 *   only moves a CLIPPING display and is a visual no-op under scaleViewport.
 *   The `trackpad` mode's cursor-follow rides the `ensureCursorVisible` seam
 *   (its caller is the trackpad layer). No pan gesture exists at fit.
 * - **Trackpad mode (the translation layer)**: while `pointerMode ===
 *   "trackpad"` on a coarse pointer with a live RFB, `attachGuiPointer`
 *   (gui-pointer.ts) owns every touch in the capture phase and re-emits
 *   synthetic mouse/wheel events on noVNC's canvas — a one-finger drag moves
 *   the virtual cursor (the rk-owned `gui-trackpad-cursor` indicator), tap
 *   left-clicks, two-finger tap right-clicks, two-finger drag scrolls,
 *   long-press drag-and-drops, pinch steps the zoom ladder. `dragViewport`
 *   is forced false while attached (applyRfbProps gates it to touch mode);
 *   `touch` mode is the untouched noVNC passthrough.
 * - **Key bar**: on coarse pointers a `GuiKeyBar` strip (gui-keybar.tsx)
 *   docks under the canvas as a flex sibling of the host div (the fit
 *   subtracts its height) with latching modifiers and a hidden-input ⌨
 *   path; every key rides `rfb.sendKey` through a ref-bound callback — a
 *   no-op without a live RFB. Its visibility is the per-viewer
 *   `rk-gui-keybar` posture (the `keyBarVisible` prop).
 * - **Toolbar pill**: a `GuiToolbar` (gui-toolbar.tsx) mounts in the canvas
 *   state for EVERY viewer (only the credentials prompt suppresses it); the
 *   reveal differs by pointer kind — coarse viewers and fullscreen start
 *   shown, a fine-pointer non-fullscreen viewer starts hidden and appears
 *   on a pointermove within TOOLBAR_REVEAL_EDGE_PX of the wrapper's top
 *   edge (fullscreen or not) or on a tap. Entering fullscreen bumps the
 *   `revealSignal` counter so the always-mounted pill shows on entry. The
 *   pill hides 3 s after the last reveal or interaction, suspended while
 *   one of its menus is open. It consumes the `guiActions` prop — the same
 *   built `GUI:` palette list app.tsx feeds the palette — firing rows by
 *   id; a ResizeObserver on the wrapper feeds it `wrapperWidth` for the
 *   overflow fold.
 * - **HiDPI**: with `hidpi` on (`rk-gui-hidpi`) the sized host's CSS size
 *   divides by `window.devicePixelRatio` (zoomedHostSize), so a 100% zoom
 *   maps one framebuffer pixel to one device pixel — crisp 1:1 on a Retina
 *   display. Client-side rendering only: `resizeSession`, `gui.geometry`, and
 *   every server-facing value are untouched; `fit` is unaffected (the fit
 *   scale is tile-bound).
 * - **Zoom badge + wheel**: any zoom prop change shows the corner
 *   `gui-zoom-badge` for ZOOM_BADGE_MS (a change restarts the timer); a
 *   capture-phase non-passive wheel listener steps the ladder one notch per
 *   WHEEL_STEP_THRESHOLD of Ctrl+wheel deltaY (lib/zoom-gesture.ts createWheelAccumulator) (mac trackpad pinch
 *   arrives as ctrl+wheel) and swallows the event so neither the browser's
 *   page zoom nor noVNC's wheel handler sees it; a wheel without Ctrl passes
 *   to noVNC untouched.
 * - **Chord gate**: a capture-phase keydown on the canvas wrapper intercepts
 *   registry chords (`shouldReclaimChord`, bound to kind "gui") BEFORE
 *   noVNC's canvas-attached handler sees them and re-dispatches a synthetic
 *   bubbling KeyboardEvent on the parent document so rk's window-level
 *   dispatcher handles the chord (the code-surface grammar — the dispatcher
 *   listens in the bubble phase, so a plain stopPropagation would eat the
 *   chord). Every other key reaches the guest. No steal guard: noVNC grabs
 *   focus only on click (`focusOnClick`), never programmatically.
 * - **Stats overlay**: the per-viewer `statsVisible` posture
 *   (`rk-gui-stats-visible`) mounts `GuiStatsOverlay` (gui-stats-overlay.tsx)
 *   in the zoom badge's corner (suppressing the badge) and, only while
 *   visible AND connected, runs the collector: fps from canvas-source
 *   `drawImage` calls wrapped on the tile canvas's 2D context INSTANCE
 *   (restored on cleanup), Mbit/s from binary bytes on the WebSocket this
 *   component constructs and hands to `new RFB(hostEl, socket, …)` (noVNC
 *   1.7's raw-channel form — `Websock.attach` coexists with our
 *   `addEventListener("message")` counter), and RTT from a timed
 *   `pingGui()` round trip every `STATS_PING_MS` — all idle while hidden
 *   (the math lives in lib/gui-stats.ts).
 * - **macOS credentials**: on `credentialsrequired` an inline password field
 *   overlays the canvas; the password lives only in component state (never
 *   storage, never a POST) and is re-asked on every reconnect. A
 *   `securityfailure` re-shows the field with the wrong-password note; Escape
 *   disconnects into the empty state.
