# sidebar-section-rail.spec.ts

Behavioural contract for the section-visibility micro-rail (iha5): a
horizontal row of four icon-only `aria-pressed` toggle buttons — **Boards ·
Server · Pane · Host**, in that fixed order — rendered as the first child of
the sidebar's `<nav>`. Each toggle flips a persisted `runkit-sidebar-section-*`
boolean; the gated section fully unmounts/remounts. Defaults (Boards/Server
on, Pane/Host off) reproduce the pre-rail rendering on both viewports, so the
mobile drawer is pure nav + footer unless the user opts in. Sessions has no
toggle (always-on core nav), and the rail itself always renders.

## Shared setup

- No test session needed: the rail and the PANE panel's empty state render on
  the plain server route.
- Desktop tests use `gotoServerReady(page, TMUX_SERVER)` (status-bar
  `Connected` gate — desktop-only chrome) and scope queries to the
  `nav[aria-label='Sessions']` sidebar.
- The mobile describe runs `test.use({ hasTouch: true, viewport: 375×812 })` —
  `hasTouch` flips Chromium's `(pointer: coarse)` media query so
  `useIsMobile()` reports mobile; navigation is a direct `page.goto` (no
  `gotoWindow`), then the drawer is opened via the `Toggle navigation`
  button.
- `railToggle(page, section)` locates a rail button by its state-stable
  aria-label (`Toggle {Section} section`); the state lives on `aria-pressed`.

## Tests

### `rail renders four toggles in order with the defaults (Boards/Server pressed, Pane/Host not)`

**What it proves:** The rail mounts at the top of the sidebar with exactly the
four contracted toggles in order, Sessions excluded, and the default
visibility booleans match the pre-rail rendering (PANE/HOST panels absent).

**Steps:**
1. `gotoServerReady(TMUX_SERVER)`.
2. Assert the `section-rail` testid is visible inside the sidebar nav.
3. Read all rail buttons' `aria-label`s; assert exact order
   `Boards → Server → Pane → Host` and that no `Sessions section` toggle
   exists anywhere.
4. Assert `aria-pressed` is `true/true/false/false` across the four toggles.
5. Assert no `/^Pane/` or `/^Host/` panel header exists in the sidebar.

### `toggling Pane on mounts the PANE panel and persists across reload (desktop)`

**What it proves:** A rail click flips the persisted boolean, mounts the
section (the 260814-ldbs desktop removal is now an opt-in default, not a hard
gate), and the state survives a full page reload.

**Steps:**
1. `gotoServerReady(TMUX_SERVER)`.
2. Click `Toggle Pane section`; assert `aria-pressed="true"` and the PANE
   panel header appears in the sidebar.
3. `page.reload()`; assert the toggle is still pressed and the PANE header is
   still rendered (localStorage persistence).

### `toggling Boards off removes the section (desktop)`

**What it proves:** Toggle-off fully unmounts a default-on section (header
gone, not merely collapsed), while the rail itself stays rendered.

**Steps:**
1. `gotoServerReady(TMUX_SERVER)`; assert the Boards section header renders.
2. Click `Toggle Boards section`; assert `aria-pressed="false"` and zero
   `/^Boards/` buttons remain in the sidebar.
3. Assert the `section-rail` testid is still visible.

### `rail defaults hold in the drawer; toggling Pane on mounts the panel and persists across reload` (mobile drawer)

**What it proves:** At 375px/coarse the drawer defaults to pure nav + footer
(no PANE/HOST panels), and the rail is the in-drawer path to opt a section
in, with the same reload persistence as desktop.

**Steps:**
1. `page.goto(/${TMUX_SERVER})`, open the drawer via `Toggle navigation`.
2. Assert Pane/Host toggles read `aria-pressed="false"` and no PANE/HOST
   headers exist in the drawer.
3. Click `Toggle Pane section`; assert the PANE header appears in the drawer.
4. `page.reload()`, re-open the drawer (`ensureDrawerOpen`); assert the PANE
   header is still rendered.
