// This spec is fully mocked: we inject the `sessions` payload (and the
// server list) via the state-socket mock + page.route and navigate to a
// terminal window route. The RefreshButton rides the L3 always-block and
// renders at first paint; the ▦ Layout chip is gated on a current window, so
// IT is the synchronization anchor proving the mocked sessions payload
// landed.
//
// Verifies the top-bar RefreshButton: on a terminal route it renders in-bar
// followed by the always-present overflow chevron as the right-most element,
// and clicking it performs a full `window.location.reload()`. The right
// cluster is registry-driven: controls render directly (no `hidden sm:flex`
// wrapper spans) and the chevron lives inside the trailing exempt block, so
// ordering is asserted by document position at a wide viewport rather than
// by flat wrapper-sibling adjacency. The theme toggle, help link,
// notification bell, and connection dot are GONE from the bar (theme/help/dot
// moved to the sidebar footer; the bell folded into the settings dialog) —
// the spec also asserts their absence.
//
// Shared setup: `beforeEach` installs the routes, navigates to the
// percent-encoded terminal window route `/default/%401` (`@1`), and waits
// for the ▦ Layout chip (terminal-gated on `currentWindow`) to be visible —
// the signal the state-socket payload has landed and `currentWindow` is set.
// The Refresh button cannot be this anchor: it rides the L3 always-block and
// is visible at first paint, before the mocked state-socket event is
// processed, so anchoring on it raced the mount-time `/select` POST.
// `**/api/servers` returns a single server `default` (so the app subscribes
// to exactly one server over the state socket); the state socket
// (mockStateSocket) carries session `dev` with two windows — `@1`
// "feature-work" (the URL target, `isActiveWindow: false`) and `@2` "other"
// (`isActiveWindow: true`) — which satisfies the `currentWindow` gate and,
// because the deep-linked `@1` is NOT the tmux-active window, makes the
// mount-time alignment fire exactly one `selectWindow(server, "@1")` POST so
// the `/select` mock is genuinely exercised (a same-window payload would
// take the no-op path and never call `/select`; a pending intent holds the
// URL on `@1`, so `currentWindow` resolves to `@1`). `**/api/windows/*/select*`
// fulfills `{ ok: true }` — the trailing `*` is required because Playwright
// globs match the full URL including the query string, and client.ts
// `withServer` appends `?server=default`; without it the POST would fall
// through to the real backend and issue a live tmux `select-window`,
// breaking the "no real backend reads" guarantee. The `/ws/terminals` mux
// WebSocket is stubbed (accepted and held open) so the terminal route mounts
// without a backend.
//
// The RefreshButton calls window.location.reload() — the routes installed
// via page.route persist across the in-page reload, so the app re-mounts on
// the same mocked data and the button reappears after the reload settles.

const SERVER = "default";

// One session with two windows. The URL deep-links to `@1`, but `@2` is the
// tmux-active window (`isActiveWindow: true`) — so app.tsx's mount-time
// alignment fires exactly one `selectWindow(server, "@1")` POST to bring tmux
// into agreement with the URL, and records a pending intent that holds the URL
// on `@1` (the URL-writeback bounce is suppressed until SSE confirms). This is
// deliberate: it makes the `/select` mock actually fire (so its interception is
// verifiable — see `selectHits` below) instead of the no-op path a URL that
// already matches the active window would take. `currentWindow` keys on the URL
// (`@1`), so the Close/Split cluster still renders.
