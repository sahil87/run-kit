/**
 * Animated window-switch (View Transitions) coverage.
 *
 * Every OTHER e2e spec runs under the config-wide reduced-motion emulation, so
 * they exercise the product's instant-switch fallback and never touch the slide
 * transition. This spec is the ONE place that opts back into motion
 * (`test.use({ contextOptions: { reducedMotion: "no-preference" } })`) and
 * drives the real animated path end-to-end.
 *
 * It guards against a systematic gate-timeout freeze: the polished capture gates
 * the new-state snapshot on the incoming window's first inbound bytes, released
 * at message-receipt time inside `ws.onmessage`. A regression that
 * makes that release unreachable (e.g. moving it back to a write seam that never
 * fires during View-Transition render suppression, or a UA group animation
 * holding `transition.finished` open) would make an animated switch hang instead
 * of completing. The assertion — the incoming window's content becomes visible
 * within a sane latency bound (well under 1s) — fails loudly on such a hang.
 *
 * Confirmation-gated motion: the slide is an EARNED signal —
 * it plays ONLY when the incoming bytes confirm within the ~300ms budget; a
 * timeout SKIPS the slide and shows a LogoSpinner "pending" mask instead, and a
 * failed switch bounces the URL back to tmux truth. Those timing-sensitive
 * branches (mask arm-at-timeout / lift-on-late-write / failure bounce) cannot be
 * forced deterministically against a live relay on localhost, so they are
 * UNIT-covered in `src/lib/window-transition.test.ts`. What this spec adds for
 * the new behavior is the deterministic fast-path invariant: a confirmed-fast
 * switch plays the slide and leaves NO pending mask stuck once it settles. A
 * brief legitimate mask flash is allowed (localhost timing can push the first
 * confirmed write past the ~300ms budget); the assertion only rules out a mask
 * left STUCK — it polls `.rk-window-switch-mask` to count 0 within the budget,
 * not an instant absence.
 *
 * Shared setup: `test.use({ contextOptions: { reducedMotion: "no-preference"
 * } })` opts this file's tests into motion, overriding the config-wide
 * reduced-motion emulation. `reducedMotion` is not a top-level `use` fixture
 * in this Playwright version; it only reaches the browser context via
 * `contextOptions`, so both the config and this override set it there —
 * without it the wrapper short-circuits to an instant switch and the
 * transition never runs. `beforeAll` creates `e2e-switch-transition-<ts>`;
 * `afterAll` kills it. `resolveWindowId(page, name)` polls `GET /api/sessions`
 * until the window surfaces, returning its stable `@N` id (the handle for
 * both URL navigation and buffer reads). `markerVisible(page, id, marker)`
 * reads the live xterm `Terminal` from `window.__rkTerminals[id]` (populated
 * only in dev/e2e builds) and scans its buffer for the marker text — the
 * WebGL canvas is not DOM-readable, so the parsed buffer is the honest
 * "content painted" signal. `SWITCH_COMPLETE_BUDGET_MS` (1s) is deliberately
 * loose against the gate's own ~300ms budget so it fails only on a genuine
 * hang, not on ordinary localhost jitter.
 *
 * The second test covers the persistent-terminal invariants on the same rig:
 * the tile grid is keyed by server (a same-server switch re-renders the
 * mounted grid rather than remounting it), so the `.xterm` DOM node must be
 * identical across a same-session sidebar switch, and the same-session ride's
 * deferred buffer clear must never present an empty surface — the old
 * window's content stays on screen until the incoming redraw paints in the
 * same frame. Emptiness is sampled from the xterm BUFFER via
 * `window.__rkTerminals` (~50ms poll across the switch; WebGL paints no DOM
 * text layer, so the buffer is the only honest read), counting a violation
 * only on two CONSECUTIVE blank samples so the one-macrotask gap between the
 * clear and the deferred write's parse can never false-positive.

   * Proves: a same-session window switch driven through the sidebar (the

   * `document.startViewTransition`) completes — the incoming window's content
   * becomes visible and the transition tears down — well under 1s. A gate
   * that never releases, or a UA group animation that holds
   * `transition.finished` open past the slide, would freeze the switch and
   * blow past the bound. It also proves the confirmation-gated-motion
   * anti-stuck-mask invariant: the pending `LogoSpinner` mask is never left
   * stuck once the switch settles — SSE confirmation and any late incoming
   * write lift it.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Create two windows `xa-<ts>` and `xb-<ts>` in the shared session and
   *    `send-keys "echo <marker>" Enter` a distinct letter-only marker into
   *    each, so each pane carries unambiguous content that the incoming
   *    redraw repaints.
   * 2. Navigate to `/${TMUX_SERVER}` (`gotoServerReady`) so the sidebar is
   *    populated; `resolveWindowId` both windows to their `@id`s.
   * 3. Deep-link into window A's terminal (`/${TMUX_SERVER}/<idA>`) so there
   *    is an OUTGOING window in view — the gate requires one (a first switch
   *    with no outgoing window is an instant switch, not the animated path
   *    under test).
   * 4. Wait for `.xterm-screen` visible, A's terminal registered, and A's
   *    marker painted — the switch must start from a real, populated outgoing
   *    terminal.
   * 5. Assert `document.startViewTransition` is a function (View Transitions
   *    support). Playwright's Desktop Chrome has it; asserting makes a runner
   *    that silently lacks it fail loudly rather than pass on the instant
   *    fallback.
   * 6. Click window B's sidebar row button (the `navigateToWindow` seam) and
   *    start a wall clock.
   * 7. Assert B's row becomes `aria-current="page"` — the switch was
   *    accepted.
   * 8. Assert B's marker becomes visible in `__rkTerminals[idB]`'s buffer
   *    within `SWITCH_COMPLETE_BUDGET_MS`, and that the measured elapsed time
   *    is under the budget — the core anti-freeze guard.
   * 9. Assert the `data-window-switch-direction` attribute the wrapper set on
   *    `<html>` is cleared within the budget — the transition's lifetime
   *    (pointer-dead window, `transition.finished`) settles on the slide's
   *    timeline.
   * 10. Poll `.rk-window-switch-mask` to count 0 within the budget — the
   *     pending mask is NOT stuck once the switch settles. On a healthy
   *     switch the gate releases fast and the mask never arms; if localhost
   *     timing pushes the first confirmed write past the ~300ms budget the
   *     mask may briefly arm, but SSE confirmation (the `aria-current` in
   *     step 7) and any late incoming write MUST lift it. A regression that
   *     never lifts the mask (the stuck-mask class of bug) leaves it present
   *     and fails.
