/**
 * Pure helpers for the window-view lens model (change 260714-t97o-web-view-lens).
 *
 * The model (docs/specs/window-views.md): a window ROW is a substrate (a tmux
 * pane); a VIEW is a lens over one derivable output of that pane. Which lenses a
 * window offers is a capability set derived from window options (Constitution
 * II/X); which lenses are on screen is shared tab state — the `@rk_win_layout`
 * window option, read via `surface-layout.ts`'s `effectiveLayout`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and DOM-free (the localStorage read is a thin
 * try/catch wrapper) — the same pure-helper + colocated-unit-test pattern as
 * `window-transition.ts` / `navigation.ts`. This module owns the capability
 * predicates and the active-web-tab selector so the rail, the layout, and the
 * palette share one capability source (no drift) with no React/DOM dependency.
 * The retired stored-view key survives one release as an inbound-only
 * translation input.
