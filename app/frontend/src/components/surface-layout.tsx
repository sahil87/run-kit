/**
 * SurfaceLayout — the tile renderer for the terminal route's center (spec
 * docs/specs/surface-layout.md § The Model, § Verbs). Replaces the legacy
 * exclusive-lens render branch AND the right-panel surface slot: the resolved
 * layout — a canonical split TREE (`lib/layout-tree.ts`) — renders as 1–N
 * TILES (offers gated by the per-viewport size floor), each mounting an
 * EXISTING renderer unchanged — `TerminalClient`
 * (tty), `IframeWindow` (web), `CodeSurface` (code), `GuiSurface` (gui —
 * lazy-loaded: noVNC's ~150 KB core is paid only by tabs that open the tile).
 * A tile may also point at ANOTHER tab's surface (a foreign leaf, `@N/<kind>`
 * — see the duplicate/foreign bullet below), and a bare leaf whose surface is
 * live in another tab renders the AWAY PLACEHOLDER instead of mounting the
 * surface.
 *
 * - **Flat rect-positioned leaves**: every leaf of the tree renders as an
 *   absolutely positioned tile in ONE flat sibling list keyed by leaf id,
 *   placed from `layoutRects(tree, containerBox, sizes, SPLIT_GAP_PX)` over a
 *   ResizeObserver-measured container (NOMINAL_BOX proportions until the first
 *   measure, so an unmeasured jsdom mount still lays out sanely). A
 *   restructure never unmounts or re-keys a surviving tile — an iframe
 *   re-parent/reload is the hazard this avoids.
 * - **Tile chrome (R7, redesigned in 260812-wfic; gap-seam 260814-011r)**: the
 *   desktop layout floats tiles as cards — 6px gutters (the SPLIT_GAP_PX seam
 *   between sibling rects), each tile a 6px-radius card (`rounded-md`) whose
 *   REST border is the dimmed
 *   `rk-card-border` (a 55% color-mix: the gap does the separating, the border
 *   only defines the card edge). The outer 6px ground inset and the
 *   `bg-bg-inset` ground itself are provided by the Shell STAGE
 *   (260814-ldbs) — this container ceded its own `p-[6px]`/`bg-bg-inset` so
 *   the tiles and the rail card share ONE continuous ground. Each tile carries
 *   a 35px header painted on the tile's own `bg-bg-primary` surface (32px
 *   content + 3px bottom rule, aligned with the sidebar rail's
 *   `border-t-[3px]` seam) — the rule separates header from content, never a
 *   second surface color, so header, content and compose strip read as one
 *   well inside the chrome frame; its verb hovers and meta chip use
 *   `bg-bg-card`, the one step above that surface —
 *   kind glyph (`SURFACE_GLYPH`) + surface name + the small meta as an inset
 *   chip (code-root basename for code, the active web tab's host for web) — with
 *   rest-visible boxed verb buttons (24×24, 26×26 coarse; 14px SVG glyphs
 *   from the `top-bar-icons.tsx` register): zoom and ✕ close (a hairline rule
 *   separates ✕ from the safe verbs; its hover turns `text-signal-red`).
 *   While a tile is zoomed its zoom verb stays `accent-green`.
 *   Single-leaf layouts render NO layout verbs (closing the last tile is
 *   disallowed and zooming one tile is meaningless). The tty header also mounts the
 *   shared `StatusDot` (agent state) when the parent passes `statusWindow`.
 *   Tty headers additionally carry a bordered PANE SEGMENT (260813-w1lf
 *   content verbs — Split H · Split V · Close Pane) at ANY arity, including
 *   the bare `tty` leaf, and visible while zoomed; a hairline separates it
 *   from the layout-verb cluster when that renders. Its verbs call the
 *   parent's `onSplitPane`/`onClosePane` callbacks. The code tile carries the
 *   same per-kind content-verb structure: Follow terminal (only while the
 *   latched code root drifts from the live derivation — the verb's presence IS
 *   the drift indicator) and Reload editor (only while the active window's
 *   frame is mounted), before the layout-verb cluster; both are
 *   palette-registered through `codeCommandsRef` (Constitution V).
 * - **Header drag — drop to snap**: a primary-button press on a tile header's
 *   background (never its buttons, pane segment, code verbs, meta chip, or
 *   menus) arms a drag; past DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX the header captures the
 *   pointer and the drag snapshots the tree, sizes, layout box, and leaf
 *   rects. Hit-testing (`lib/layout-drop.ts`) offers the hovered tile's center
 *   (swap), its edge bands (split beside), and the layout box's outer 18px
 *   (span a side at 50%); the overlay previews the RESULT tree at the
 *   viewer's sizes (the dragged destination filled accent-green), marks a
 *   same-arrangement drop "no change", and refuses a drop that breaks the
 *   150×100 floor with a red "too small". Release on a `move` commits exactly
 *   one write: the viewer's sizes under the new structure signature, then
 *   `onApplyLayout(result.tree)` (the parent's ONE mutation path); focus
 *   lands on the dragged tile's new position. Escape, release outside/over
 *   the dragged tile, `pointercancel`, a window switch, and a mid-drag
 *   `layout` prop change (a stale snapshot) all cancel with no write. The
 *   drag never arms on a coarse pointer, a zoomed render, or a single-leaf
 *   layout (and the mobile branch renders one tile). The native web engine
 *   hides its guest for the drag's duration (the `move` posture — the overlay
 *   cannot paint over a composited WebContentsView).
 * - **Focused tile (260812-wfic R2)**: transient component state — the LEAF
 *   that last received pointer/keyboard interaction (pointerdown-capture +
 *   focusin seams on the tile wrapper for parent-DOM interaction; the iframe
 *   tiles — `CodeSurface`, `IframeWindow` — report in-frame interaction via
 *   `onInteract`, since no parent-document event fires when focus enters
 *   iframe content). The focused tile's border
 *   and kind glyph turn `accent-green` (the tmux active-pane metaphor);
 *   suppressed at arity 1. Default = the first leaf in reading order; falls
 *   back there when the focused leaf leaves the layout. The focused KIND is
 *   reported upward via `onFocusedKindChange` (app.tsx mirrors it for the
 *   `ttyOnly` shortcut gate), the focused leaf id via `onFocusedLeafChange`
 *   (the palette's directional swaps act on the focused leaf), and focus is
 *   settable by kind through the `focusTileRef` seam (the `zoomToggleRef`
 *   pattern — the palette's `Tile: Focus <Surface>`, first leaf of the kind).
 * - **Zoom (R6)**: one tile full-center, the others hidden at display level.
 *   Per-viewer state, persisted as the zoomed LEAF ID under
 *   `rk-layout-zoom:{server}:{@N}` (the mobile switch group reads the same
 *   key; its kind writes double as a unique bare leaf's id, and an exact id
 *   that left the tree resolves to its kind's first leaf); the toggle renders
 *   only when arity > 1.
 * - **Hide-never-unmount (P3)**: a leaf opened earlier this route visit stays
 *   mounted (`hidden` class) when closed or zoomed away, so iframe /
 *   terminal state survives. The "ever opened" bookkeeping is keyed by leaf
 *   id and is per-window — `app.tsx` keys this component by server, so the set
 *   (with the other per-window transient state) resets via the
 *   `[server, windowId]` reset effect on a window switch.
 * - **Code-frame retention (the P3 cross-window half)**: the `code` tile
 *   additionally survives a same-server WINDOW switch — the component keeps a
 *   per-server ordered list of live frame records (`{windowId, src, root}`,
 *   most-recently-shown last), rendering every non-active record as a
 *   display-hidden tile (`hidden` class, never `visibility`/off-screen) and
 *   evicting on overflow (cap 3 desktop / 1 mobile), window kill, non-follow
 *   root divergence, or a reachability true→false flip. An iframe unmount is
 *   a page unload — code-server disposes the connection and kills the
 *   workbench's extension host (~250–320 MB each, hence the bound), and a
 *   fresh boot costs seconds while a display-hidden frame re-shows in ~16 ms.
 * - **Dividers**: one divider per adjacent sibling pair of every split
 *   (`layoutDividers`), rendered in the 6px gutter with a 14px hit zone
 *   centered on the seam. Drag mutates SIZES only (never the tree): the
 *   pointer position maps to the FIRST sibling's fraction of the pair's
 *   combined extent, clamped via `clampSiblingFraction` (280px floor both
 *   sides on the divider's own axis), the pair's sum held constant, and the
 *   full sizes persist per (window, structure signature) ON RELEASE ONLY.
 *   Tiles stay live mid-drag — no suspension/unmount (the board pane-resize
 *   bug class); tile content gets `pointer-events: none` so iframes cannot
 *   swallow pointermove (the RightPanel drag-handle pattern). The chrome is
 *   the gap-seam three-state treatment (`rk-divider`/`rk-sash`/`rk-grips` in
 *   globals.css): 3 rest grip dots, a rounded accent-green sash pill on hover
 *   (~150ms anti-flicker delay) and drag (immediate). Where a divider's end
 *   meets a perpendicular divider, a `surface-divider-intersection` zone
 *   lights BOTH sashes on hover and drags BOTH fraction pairs at once (each
 *   clamped on its own axis), persisted on release.
 * - **Duplicate and foreign tty tiles**: the muxed relay supports N clients
 *   per pane, so two bare tty tiles are legal (`tty`, `tty#2` by
 *   reading-order occurrence), and a foreign leaf (`@12/tty`) tiles ANOTHER
 *   window's terminal — its relay stream opens with the home window id and
 *   `isolate: true` (the `_rk-iso-*` attach, never fighting the home tab).
 *   Only the FIRST BARE tty leaf in reading order receives the shared
 *   `wsRef`/`focusRef` holder (a foreign tty never takes it); every tty tile
 *   mounts its own stream bucket, and the FOCUSED tty tile — bare or foreign
 *   — registers as the shell's focused terminal with its own
 *   server/session/window/wsRef, so the compose strip, bottom bar, and focus
 *   memory follow the tile the user is in.
 * - **Away placeholder**: a BARE leaf whose kind is named by the route
 *   window's server-derived `awayIn` (a live holder exists) renders
 *   `SurfacePlaceholder` INSTEAD of the surface — the mount is gated, so an
 *   away tty opens no relay stream. The placeholder carries bring back (the
 *   parent's `onSendHome` with from = the holder), go to the holder
 *   (`onGoToWindow`), the tty status dot, and ✕ (hidden when it is the only
 *   leaf — a layout never renders empty). A foreign tile's header identifies
 *   its home tab (name chip) and carries a ↩ verb (`onSendHome` with from =
 *   the route window), disabled while the home window is dead.
 * - **Sidebar row-drag borrow**: a window-row HTML5 drag (WINDOW_DRAG_MIME)
 *   in flight arms a drop-catcher overlay above all tiles — window-level
 *   dragstart/dragend listeners (the payload is readable at dragstart), the
 *   header drag's mid-drag seam, and the external-leaf mode of
 *   `hitTest`/`resolveDrop`. Edge zones insert `@<dragged>/tty` and commit
 *   through `onBorrowDrop` (the parent's borrow helper); the center zone and
 *   the refused drops (route window's own row, address already in the layout,
 *   cross-server) preview "no change" and write nothing.
 *
 * Presentational by contract (the view-switcher/right-panel precedent): the
 * tree lives in `app.tsx` and arrives as the `layout` prop; verbs call the
 * parent's callbacks (`onClose` addressed by LEAF ID, `onApplyLayout` handed
 * the drop's result tree), which run the pure mutations + persistence/URL
 * mirroring. The component owns
 * only transient interaction state: zoom, the in-flight drags, and the
 * mount-once bookkeeping.
