// Top-bar overlap fixes e2e — in the mid-width band between the `sm`
// breakpoint (640px) and ~900px, the left breadcrumb crumbs compress to an
// ellipsis and clip inside the nav box instead of overflowing and painting
// over the centered `Tab: <name>` heading. Proves the degradation ladder —
// long crumbs truncate (the `min-w-0` chain unblocks the existing `truncate
// max-w-[16ch]`), the breadcrumb `<nav>` clips residual overflow
// (`overflow-hidden` + an explicit `min-w-[46px] sm:min-w-[150px]` floor),
// the server crumb hides below `md` and reappears at `md+` (below `md` the
// ancestor navigation paths are the palette's `Go: tmux Server` / `Go:
// Host`), and the center heading is never compressed into overlap (the
// center grid track's `min-w-0` was removed so the `auto` column holds its
// content floor, with the `sm:min-w-[28ch]` inner anchor kept at `sm:`). The
// 375px mobile leaf and 1024px+ desktop layouts are re-verified for no
// regression.
//
// Shared setup: file-level `beforeAll` creates a dedicated tmux session on
// the isolated test server with a deliberately LONG session name
// (`e2e-overlap-longsessionname-<ts>`, ~35 chars, well over the crumb's 16ch
// cap) and a window with a deliberately LONG name
// (`overlap-verylongwindowname-<ts>`), so both the session crumb and the
// centered heading are under genuine truncation pressure in the overlap band;
// `afterAll` kills the session. `resolveWindow`/`gotoWindow` are thin
// file-local wrappers over the shared helpers in `_ready.ts` (the server +
// session are bound here so call sites keep their two-arg shape).
// `intersects(a, b)` is a rect-overlap helper (AABB test) used to assert the
// nav box and heading box share no area. Viewports: MOBILE 375×812, MID

   *    `Switch session` dropdown is gone) — and assert
   *    `scrollWidth > clientWidth` on that chip (the name is truncated to

   * 5. Assert the nav's computed `overflow-x` is `hidden` — the clip
   *    backstop is active, so content past the nav floor is clipped at the
   *    nav edge rather than painted over the heading (a clipped child
   *    legitimately keeps a layout box wider than its clipping parent, so
   *    the meaningful proof is the computed style + the no-overlap
   *    assertion in step 3, not a layout-box comparison).
