 * Sidebar window-row multi-select state (260807-nf9f).
 *

 * consumers live in different subtrees: the tree that paints and mutates the
 * selection is `components/sidebar/index.tsx`, while the command palette that
 * ACTS on it is composed in `app.tsx`. Follows the `window-store.ts` pattern
 * (plain zustand `create`, actions colocated with state).
 *
 * Keys are the composite `${server}:${windowId}` handle — the same key the
 * window store's `entryKey()` and the sidebar's roving `data-row-key` use, since
 * tmux window ids (`@N`) are unique per server only. All the set arithmetic
 * lives in the pure `lib/selection.ts`; this store only holds state.
 *
 * Selection is WINDOW-ROWS-ONLY: session and server rows are never selectable
 * (each window is a worktree/change and PR status is per-window), and ghost /
 * optimistic rows (no real windowId) are excluded by the callers' guards.

   * that should move the anchor already moves it as part of its own write

   * so a slow batch races the user: they can build a whole NEW selection while
   * it is still POSTing. A terminal `clear()` / `selectOnly(failedKeys)` acts on
   * whatever the store holds at settle time and would silently destroy that new
   * selection. Reconciling against the batch's own keys makes the batch's write
   * scoped, so concurrent batches and a concurrent user selection all survive.
   *
