/**
 * The currently-focused terminal across the app. There is exactly one
 * focused terminal at any time, or `null` when no terminal is mounted
 * (e.g., the dashboard route).
 *
 * Producers:
 *   - `TerminalClient` (single-terminal route): registers on mount, clears
 *     on unmount.
 *   - `BoardPane` (board route): registers on focus events (click,
 *     cycle, initial pane). Does NOT clear on focus LOSS — the next pane
 *     to gain focus overwrites (avoids a transient `null` during a cycle).
 *     It DOES clear on UNMOUNT, iff it is still the registered focused pane,
 *     so leaving the board (board → `/$server` tiles) does not leave a stale
 *     target for the compose strip (260718-dhdj).
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - `BottomBar`: reads `focused?.wsRef` to send keystrokes/input to
 *     the active terminal. The existing `readyState !== OPEN` guard
 *     handles the `null` case naturally.
 *   - `ComposeStrip`: reads `focused` live at send time to target the
 *     currently-focused pane's `wsRef` and to derive its `→ {window}`
 *     target label. Compose enablement is a persisted `ChromeContext`
 *     preference (`composeStripEnabled`), NOT held here — the strip is a
 *     single global surface, not a per-terminal one (260718-dhdj).
