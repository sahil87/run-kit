/**
 * Pure builder for the command-palette per-server adopt actions
 * (`Server: Adopt <name> into run-kit`). Follows the
 * lib/palette/server-protect.ts / server-kill.ts pattern (pure,
 * dependency-free, unit-testable) so the enumeration and label composition
 * are verifiable without mounting the whole shell. The action body is a thin
 * `onAdopt(name)` callback passed in by the caller (app.tsx wires it to the
 * `requestAdoptServer` context trigger, funnelling every entry through the
 * layout-mounted adopt confirm Dialog).
 *
 * EXTERNAL servers only: the backend's `managed` flag marks rk-daemon by
 * derivation and any @rk_srv_managed server (rk-born or adopted), so consumers
 * gate on `managed === false` — an old backend omitting the field renders NO
 * adopt entries. rk-daemon is additionally guarded by name, matching the
 * protect builder's exclusion.
