# worktrees never collide on the stub. The same value is exported to the
# playwright run below so the spec and the backend agree on the port.
# The child closes the worktree lock fd before exec (it must not pin the lock

# Concurrency throttle (load, not correctness — the derived identity already
# isolates across worktrees, and the per-worktree lock above is the
# correctness lock within one; ordering and the no-deadlock argument live in
# that block's comment): a flock counting semaphore over RK_E2E_SLOTS slot files
# (/tmp/rk-e2e-slot-<uid>-{0..N-1}, default N=2, 1 = strict series) shared by
# every worktree on this box. The suite is timing-sensitive under parallel
# Playwright+Vite+Go CPU load, so cross-worktree runs queue for a slot before
# entering the Playwright phase. Server startup above is NOT throttled (cheap
# and port-isolated); `just pw` stays unthrottled (interactive lane). The uid
# suffix keeps slots per-user — opening another user's slot file (or inheriting
# their lock holder) must not abort this run under `set -e`.
