   * reach `/` without an attached server.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Navigate to `/`.
   * 2. Assert the `Host health` region (labelled section) is visible.
   * 3. Assert its `Host Health` heading is visible.
   * 4. Wait for the `cpu` metric label to appear — proving the server-neutral
   *    `?metrics=1` stream delivered a snapshot to `/` (the backend sends its
   *    cached metrics on connect) and the shared `HostMetrics` component
   *    replaced the "No metrics" placeholder. The 10s timeout only absorbs a
   *    cold air-compiled backend on the first connection.
   * 5. Assert the `mem` metric label is also visible.
   * 6. Assert the `+ New Server` button (always present in the server-tile
   *    grid) is visible — proving the existing grid still renders below the
   *    new zone.
