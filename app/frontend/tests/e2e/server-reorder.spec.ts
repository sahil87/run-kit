/**
 * Behavioural contract for the server-reorder backend surface: the
 * `POST /api/servers/order` endpoint (writes each server's `@rk_srv_rank`),
 * and the nullable `rank` field on `GET /api/servers` (array stays alphabetical).
 *
 * Why this slice (not a drag simulation): server drag-reorder needs ≥2
 * regular (non-infra) servers, but the isolated e2e harness only provides
 * `rk-test-*` sockets (which `isInfraServer` treats as non-draggable infra)
 * and cannot create genuinely-regular servers without leaking sockets outside
 * the `rk-test-e2e*` teardown glob. Native HTML5 drag is also unreliable to
 * simulate in Playwright, and `page.reload()` does not commit under the SPA's
 * long-lived state socket. So this spec exercises the load-bearing surface —
 * the order endpoint end-to-end against the live backend, which is
 * deterministic. The comparator, context re-sort, drag
 * handlers, and palette Move actions are covered by Vitest unit tests.
 *
 * Shared setup: uses `E2E_TMUX_SERVER` (default `rk-test-e2e`) as the live
 * server; no extra sessions are created — the endpoint operates on the server
 * socket itself. `apiBase(baseURL)` resolves the backend origin (default
 * `http://localhost:${RK_PORT ?? 3020}`). Persisted rank is harmless leftover
 * state; no teardown reset is needed (the option has no HTTP "unset" and
 * ranks don't affect the alphabetical `/api/servers` array).
 */

  /**
   * Proves: posting `{order: [rk-test-e2e]}` returns `{ok: true}`, writes
   * rank 0 to that server, and `GET /api/servers` then reports `rank: 0` on
   * its entry while the array remains alphabetical.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. `POST /api/servers/order` with `{order: [TMUX_SERVER]}`; assert `ok` +
   *    `{ok: true}` body.
   * 2. `GET /api/servers`; assert the `name` array equals its own
   *    alphabetical sort (order contract preserved).
   * 3. Find the `TMUX_SERVER` entry; assert `rank === 0`.
