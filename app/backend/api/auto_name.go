// Auto-name on idle (260822-q675; operator-session.md Phase 3 item 9). Window
// names go stale the moment an agent's work drifts from the spawn-time name;
// the natural moment to fix one is right after a work burst ends, when the
// transcript says what the tab actually did. This tracker rides the SAME SSE
// per-tick assembly seam as waitingPushTracker (its structure mirrors
// waiting_push.go: own mutex, clock + deliver seams for tests, pure decision,
// detached fan-out, post-loop retain) and detects the per-window transition
// busy → idle (busy = `active` or `waiting`; idle = exactly `idle`;
// empty/unknown is neither — a window with no agent hooks never triggers, and
// a first-ever observation is not a transition).
//
// On a transition it hands the server's operator window a fix-tab-name request
// through the SAME delivery core the HTTP endpoint uses (deliverOperatorRequest
// in operator.go) — run-kit owns the derivable trigger, the operator owns the
// rename judgment (the actuation-loop razor). Eligibility is derived entirely
// from the tick's already-fetched snapshot (no second FetchSessions): the
// server must HAVE an operator window, the subject must not BE the operator,
// and the subject must carry an AgentSessionRef (the template's
// requiresAgentSessionRef).
// No operator ⇒ the feature degrades to absent: nothing fires, nothing logs at
// error level.
//
// Rate limits: a per-window cooldown (stamps on every ATTEMPT — including one
// the delivery core skips because the operator is busy — so a busy operator
// never converts deferred transitions into a later burst), a per-server
// min-gap (the operator's AgentState lags a delivery by a hook round-trip, so
// back-to-back transitions must not double-deliver), and at most ONE candidate
// per server per tick (excess transitions are dropped, NOT stamped — their next
// transition may fire). In-memory only: no queue, no persistence, no retry — a
// daemon restart forgets cooldowns, exactly like the waiting-push episode map
// (Constitution II).
