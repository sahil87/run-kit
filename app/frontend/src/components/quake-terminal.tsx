/**
 * The quake terminal — the operator-chat surface: a global pull-down drawer
 * overlay on desktop, available on every route. Mounted ONCE at the
 * persistent root layout
 * (app.tsx, beside the single CommandPalette mount); every entry point — the
 * registry chord, the palette action, the palette's Ask-operator fallback row,
 * the mobile tongue, and the overflow-menu row — reaches it through the
 * QUAKE_TERMINAL_EVENT
 * document seam (lib/quake-terminal.ts).
 *
 * The seam forks on form factor. Desktop runs the ⌘J two-state machine
 * (lib/quake-terminal.ts): rest ⇄ open (drawer down, the docked compose
 * textarea focused — focus and the expanded drawer are linked, so one chord
 * engages both and the next releases both). Enter in the docked compose
 * sends; Esc on the Operator Terminal segment first yields focus to the
 * embedded terminal, then releases to rest (on the list segments the first
 * Esc releases); the palette action lands on open+focused; a click outside
 * the quake terminal's own DOM (the drawer or the quake launcher) collapses
 * to rest unless the drawer is pinned (⌖ — an ephemeral module slot, reset at
 * rest; only the outside-click path is suspended, the chord/Esc/▼ still
 * collapse), same destination as the
 * header button. The machine is the controlling state — the drawer's internal
 * open flag follows it through the slide machinery.
 *
 * On MOBILE there is no drawer at all: every request resolves the operator
 * window and NAVIGATES to its ordinary terminal route, reusing that route's
 * chrome wholesale (the top-bar `Terminal: <window>` heading, the compose
 * strip, the bottom-bar key chips, the `--bottom-bar-pad` safe-area
 * handling). The palette fallback row's query is seeded into the operator
 * route's compose-strip draft instead of auto-sending, and a navigation from
 * a terminal route carries the origin window as `?from=` so the operator
 * route's compose strip keeps the templated chat lane behind its context
 * chip. A request against an operator-less server toasts the hint and stays
 * put. The component still mounts on mobile (the seam listener lives here)
 * but renders nothing; a desktop→mobile viewport flip resets the machine to
 * rest and tears down any in-flight slide state, so no effect or frame
 * survives the gate.
 *
 * Anatomy (desktop): ONE header row folding the
 * Operator Terminal | Operator Tasks | Cron List | Cron Log segment strip
 * (the shared `QuakeSegments` strip from terminal-activity-tabs.tsx, driven
 * by the quake terminal's local ephemeral state) together with the meta
 * cluster (the server picker on param-less multi-server routes, else the
 * server name; the operator window's live agent state; the operator loop's
 * tick-age stamp), the pin, and the collapse affordance — then the body: on
 * Operator Terminal an embedded LIVE
 * terminal view of the operator window (a plain TerminalClient over the
 * shared /ws/terminals relay mux — the same mechanism a board pane uses,
 * registerFocus off so the BottomBar keeps its target, `transparent` on so
 * the glass background shows through the cells); on Operator Tasks the
 * `WatchedTasks` watchlist (the shared
 * `WatchedTable`, dense variant — a row click navigates through the router to
 * the window's terminal and collapses the drawer explicitly: a click inside
 * the quake terminal bypasses the outside-click collapse, which stands down
 * for clicks inside the quake terminal's DOM); on Cron List / Cron Log the
 * `CronStaleBanner` (mounted once above either cron body) over the `CronList`
 * or `CronLog` (inline variant — the entry detail sheet renders
 * in-container). On every non-terminal segment the TerminalClient is
 * UNMOUNTED, so the drawer holds at
 * most one relay stream. While open the drawer carries the compose DOCKED at
 * its bottom edge (the QuakeCompose strip below): the shared compose seam's
 * one desktop view, with the inline status/error line as its first row (one
 * home — nothing renders at the drawer's top edge). The strip drives the ONE
 * shared compose
 * seam (lib/quake-terminal.ts) — same draft, same `sendToWindow(...,
 * "submit", "agent")` delivery with chat-send busy semantics (allow + probe —
 * no client-side busy gate), same upload path. Structured send failures
 * surface inline (never toasts) and the composed text survives a failure for
 * retry/edit. At rest the compose's standing affordance is the top-bar quake
 * launcher (components/quake-launcher.tsx); while the drawer is open the
 * launcher collapses to its glyph + chord and re-focuses the docked textarea
 * on click.
 *
 * On a terminal route the compose carries a dismissable context chip (default
 * attached) naming the subject window — the route's window, or the validated
 * `?from=` origin on the operator window's own route; with it attached, sends
 * ride the templated chat lane (`sendOperatorRequest(server, subjectWindowId,
 * "user-message", text)` — a server-derived source envelope wraps the text,
 * the busy gate and queue are skipped server-side), otherwise the direct
 * lane. The quake terminal stamps the subject into the lib's chat-subject
 * store; the
 * quake launcher fork lives in `sendOperatorMessage` and the compose strip's
 * plain-submit fork keys on the same store, both read AT SEND TIME, so a
 * pendingSend delivered in the same commit as a chip reset sees the reset,
 * never a stale closure.
 *
 * The desktop drawer is a true quake slide: it mounts translated fully above
 * the top-bar seam (an `overflow-clip` wrapper hides the raised portion) and
 * transitions to rest, and a close request drives the raised class and holds
 * the unmount until `transitionend` (with a timeout fallback), so the terminal
 * stream tears down AFTER the slide, not mid-animation. Reduced motion zeroes
 * both directions including the exit delay. The drawer is mouse-resizable
 * from every exposed edge — the full bottom edge (the hanging tongue is its
 * visual pull tab), both sides, and the two bottom corners (both axes at
 * once); each edge moves only its own side, so a corner tracks the pointer
 * and the drawer may rest off-center (`centerOffsetPx`). Height clamps
 * 25–85vh, width 420px–96vw, the offset keeps the drawer inside the viewport;
 * the grabbed edge tints accent-green, double-click on any grip resets,
 * drags suspend the slide transition, and the geometry persists per-viewer
 * in localStorage — and its
 * background is glass: `color-mix`-alpha bg-primary at the per-viewer opacity
 * (default 0.95, settings-dialog row) over a fixed 6px backdrop blur, disabled
 * entirely at α=1.
 *
 * File paste/drop inside the drawer (or the quake launcher) uploads via the
 * existing
 * `uploadFile` client scoped to the OPERATOR window's session and
 * insert-delivers each returned path to the operator pane (`"raw"` send mode
 * — staged into the TUI composer, never submitted; the user's own Enter
 * submits). With no operator window resolved, file paste is a no-op — the
 * hint line is the answer.
 *
 * Open/closed is ephemeral per-viewer component state (Constitution IV — no
 * URL, tmux, or localStorage write beyond the ordinary route URL;
 * geometry/opacity are the carve-out preferences). Availability degrades to
 * ABSENT: a server with no operator window renders a single hint line and
 * opens no stream (mobile: a toast, and no navigation).

  // in the pane below); the chord, Esc, and ▼ still collapse. Two things a
  // plain "collapse on any outside click" would get
  // wrong, both handled below by DEFERRING the decision rather than acting
  // inline:
  //   (1) An entry-point trigger outside the quake terminal's DOM (a palette
  //       or menu
  //       opener's retarget) reads and
  //       re-writes the machine itself in response to the SAME click — the
  //       collapse must never race that write. Capturing
  //       `getQuakeMachineActivity()` in the CAPTURE phase (before the
  //       trigger's own bubble-phase onClick runs) and re-checking it after a
  //       macrotask settle catches this: if the trigger's handler already
  //       changed activity — even a same-VALUE re-open while already `open`,
  //       which is a no-op by value but still
  //       increments activity — this handler backs off and leaves whatever
  //       that handler decided standing.
  //   (2) A click that opens an unrelated modal (the settings dialog, the
  //       command palette) is outside the quake terminal's DOM but must NOT
  //       collapse it — the settings dialog in particular needs the quake
  //       terminal
  //       to stay open so its opacity control can live-apply. The trigger
  //       trigger itself may carry no quake terminal marker, so
  //       this checks for ANY currently-open `role="dialog"` at settle time
  //       instead of the clicked target's ancestry — a modal owns the
  //       interaction while open, so the quake terminal holding still behind
  //       it is
  //       the correct call regardless of where inside (or outside) the
  //       dialog the click landed.
  // A macrotask (not a microtask) is the settle mechanism: it runs after
  // React has committed and painted the triggering click's own state update
  // (mounting the settings dialog's DOM, or the opener's own
  // re-render), which a same-tick microtask cannot reliably guarantee.

/**
 * The docked compose strip — the shared compose seam's one desktop view while
 * the drawer is open, docked at the drawer's bottom edge (the prompt →
 * compose → reply eye line every terminal route already uses). Top to bottom:
 * the status line (the inline send/upload error or the minimal
 * sending…/uploading… indicator, rendered only while one is live — the
 * status's one home), the header row (the `◉ → operator` addressee label with
 * the shared OperatorStateGlyph's live-state dot, the chat-lane context chip,
 * right-aligned key hints), and the textarea.
 *
 * The textarea rides the shared store (`useOperatorCompose` /
 * `setOperatorComposeText`) and the `quake` Enter policy of the shared
 * classifier: plain Enter sends once through `sendOperatorMessage` (the same
 * templated/direct fork as everywhere) with focus retained for follow-ups,
 * Shift+Enter inserts a local newline, an empty/whitespace Enter is a no-op.
 * Auto-grow is the route strip's bounded idiom (lib/textarea-autogrow.ts).
 * Esc is the ladder's first rung: on the Operator Terminal segment it yields
 * to the embedded terminal (prevented, so the drawer's document listener
 * skips this press and the next Esc collapses) — but only when a terminal is
 * actually mounted to receive focus (an operator-less drawer's Esc collapses
 * on the first press, like the list segments); on the list segments the
 * event is left alone and the collapse rung fires on the first press.
 *
 * The `engaged` flag (the lib's module slot) says the compose owns input:
 * true while the textarea has real focus; a blur whose relatedTarget lies
 * inside the strip wrapper does NOT clear it, so the context chip's ✕ click
 * lands. The blur handler lives on the strip WRAPPER (bubbling), not the
 * textarea, so focus leaving the strip FROM the chip's ✕ is observed too.
 * While engaged the textarea carries the accent border — and the
 * collapsed launcher in the top bar reads the same slot.
