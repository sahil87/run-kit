// discover where the server would bind — the server-URL derivation formerly
// carried by `rk context`.
//
// Resolution precedence (see resolveOrigin): explicit RK_HOST/RK_PORT env in
// the caller's environment wins; inside a tmux pane, the covering server's
// @rk_srv_origin tmux option (stamped by the covering daemon) is read next;
// otherwise the config default (127.0.0.1:3000).
//
// The value is a HEURISTIC, NOT a liveness probe: it does not read a .env
// file, does not check the port owner, and does not confirm a server is
// actually running. (Smarter port-owner discovery is a deferred enhancement;
// this command is the seam that keeps that door open.)
