/**
 * Reactive keybinding store (260730-g40a). Thin React integration over the
 * pure `lib/keybindings.ts` registry: reads the per-device override diffs
 * from `localStorage["runkit-keybindings"]`, resolves the effective map for
 * this host, and keeps every subscriber in sync.
 *
 * Same-tab reactivity uses an in-module pub/sub (the
 * `use-local-storage-enum.ts` pattern — the native `storage` event fires only
 * across tabs); cross-tab sync rides `storage` for free. All writes funnel
 * through `persist()` so subscribers can never miss an update.
 *
 * MACRO-AWARE (260730-hbyh): the effective map resolves over the builtin
 * defaults PLUS the stored macros (`lib/macros.ts`, projected via
 * `macroToBinding` — keyless defaults whose combos live solely in the
 * override diffs). Because macros ride this one map, the dispatcher, palette
 * hints, the overlay tier-map, the terminal seam, and steal-with-warning all
 * see them with no consumer changes.
