/**
 * Pure builders for the command-palette SELECTION command family (260807-nf9f):
 * `Selection: Select all merged (N)`, bulk close/send, and one
 * `Selection: Move N window(s) to <session>` entry per eligible target session.
 *
 * Follows the lib/palette-pin.ts / lib/palette-move.ts pattern (pure,
 * dependency-free, unit-testable) so the label composition, merged derivation,
 * and eligibility gating are verifiable without mounting the shell. The action
 * bodies are thin callbacks passed in by the caller (app.tsx wires them to the
 * selection store, compose target, and sequential batch executors).
 *
 * The bulk move is gated to a SINGLE server: tmux cannot move a window across
 * tmux servers (the sidebar's drag-and-drop path already rejects cross-server
 * drops), so a cross-server selection is offered no move targets at all. The
 * palette's own fuzzy filter IS the session picker — there is deliberately no
 * picker dialog and no create-if-missing entry (Constitution IV).
