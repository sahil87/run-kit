/**
 * Idle contract for the "Server not found" fallback: loading a route whose
 * tmux server the daemon does not have renders the fallback once and then
 * leaves the main thread quiet — no re-render or redirect loop keeps the
 * renderer busy while the tab is open.
 *
 * Shared setup: no tmux fixture — the e2e rig's daemon knows only the
 * isolated `rk-test-e2e-<token>-*` socket family, so any other server name is
 * a guaranteed miss and the three-way route guard resolves `not-found` as
 * soon as the server list loads. The idle oracle is a CDP session on the
 * page: `Performance.getMetrics`'s `TaskDuration` is the CUMULATIVE
 * main-thread task time in seconds, so the delta across an idle window is
 * the page's script cost — a spinning page accrues ~1 s per second of wall
 * time, a quiet SPA well under the budget. Process-level CPU is deliberately
 * not asserted (too noisy for a gate; that is the perf-idle-cpu instrument's
 * job).
