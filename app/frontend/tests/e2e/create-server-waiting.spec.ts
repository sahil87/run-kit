/**
 * Behavioural contract for the transient "Server not found" flash after
 * creating a tmux server: creating a server through the command palette must
 * land on the working server view without ever rendering the "Server not
 * found" error screen, and the not-found screen must still show for a
 * genuinely-unknown server URL.
 *
 * Shared setup: no `beforeAll` session setup — the first test relies only on
 * the always-present e2e tmux server (`E2E_TMUX_SERVER`, the worktree's
 * derived e2e primary) being non-empty so the server list is loaded and
 * non-empty (the precondition under which the old `servers.length > 0` guard
 * misfired). `afterAll` `kill-server`s the server the test created; the name
 * is built from this worktree's `TMUX_FAMILY` anchor with the Playwright
 * `process.pid` as the second-to-last hyphen field, so the family-anchored
 * global teardown also reaps it if `afterAll` is missed. Desktop viewport
 * (1024×768).

   * Proves: when the user creates a new server via the command palette while at
   * least one server already exists (list loaded and non-empty), the UI
   * navigates to the new server and reaches the connected server view without
   * the "Server not found" error screen appearing — the pending-marker +
   * three-way guard suppress the false negative the old binary guard produced.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Navigate to the existing e2e server (`/${TMUX_SERVER_A}`) and wait for
   *    the `Connected` indicator in the status bar (the desktop sidebar footer
   *    is gone, so the status-bar dot is the gate).
   * 2. Open the command palette (`Meta+k`), type `Server: Create`, press Enter.
   * 3. In the "Create tmux server" dialog, fill the `Server name` field with
   *    the freshly-generated server name and click the `Create` button.
   * 4. Assert the URL navigates to `/${CREATED_SERVER}`.
   * 5. Race two outcomes — whichever appears first wins: the `Connected`
   *    indicator becoming visible vs. the "Server not found" text becoming
   *    visible. Each side swallows its own 15s timeout so the loser can't
   *    surface as an unhandled rejection.
   * 6. Assert the race winner is `connected`, not `not-found`. Racing (rather
   *    than asserting `toHaveCount(0)` only after `Connected` settles) is what
   *    catches a *transient* flash: if the error screen renders even briefly
   *    during navigation it wins the race and the test fails.
