 * single-server derivation, and pruning are unit-testable without mounting the
 * tree — the same discipline as lib/palette-move.ts and lib/board-reorder.ts.
 * The store (store/selection-store.ts) and the sidebar tree are thin consumers.
 *
 * The selection is keyed by the SAME composite `${server}:${windowId}` key the
 * rest of the app already uses as a globally-unique window handle: the window
 * store's `entryKey()` and the sidebar's roving `data-row-key`. tmux window ids
 * (`@N`) are unique per server only, so the server prefix is required.
