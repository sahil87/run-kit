## Goal

An agent (or the operator at a shell) can **fully address and drive the
run-kit UI with tmux commands alone** — open a tab, choose its layout, add a
web tab, point the code surface at a folder, collapse it to one surface — and every
viewer looking at that tab sees the result. run-kit's frontend becomes a
faithful *renderer of tmux state*, not a second store that must be nudged.

Corollary: `rk present`, the layout verbs, the surface toggles, the code
bridge's host resolution, and the `?layout=` deep links all become **sugar
over `set-option`**.

---

## The Layer Stack

Two axes. The first is tmux's and needs nothing new; the second is run-kit's
and this spec defines it.

```
axis 1 — tmux substrate                     axis 2 — run-kit lenses over a tab
host ─ server (-L) ─ session ─ window ─ pane         tab ─ surface ─ [web tab]
                              └─ "tab" ─────────────► @N
```

| Noun | Is | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **host** | a machine running `rk serve` | implicit (local daemon / `$TMUX` socket) | cross-host goes through `rk remote` tunnels; **not** in the address string (v1) |
| **server** | a tmux server | `-L <name>` | as `rk mux` today |
| **session** | tmux session | `=<name>:` | exact-match form, never fuzzy |
| **tab** | a tmux **window** | `@N` | immutable id; window *name* belongs to the user and is never parsed |
| **pane** | tmux pane | `%N` | substrate only — lenses render over the tab, not a pane |
| **surface** | a lens kind over the tab | `@N/<surface>` | `tty` · `web` · `code` · `desktop` · `agents` (open registry, window-views.md) |
| **web tab** | one page inside the `web` surface | `@N/web/<n>` | 1-based index; the only surface with sub-addresses (v1) |

The **tab is not the terminal**. `tty` is a lens over the window's panes and
is the one surface that can never be closed (R3), but it is a surface like
the others. `rk tab …` never means "the tty".

---

## The One Rule — Tab State vs Viewer Preferences

> **Anything addressable as `@N/…` is a tmux option. Anything about the
> viewer's device is not.**

| Class | Lives in | Agent-writable? | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tab state** — what the tab shows | tmux window options `@rk_win_*` | **yes** | layout shape+order, web tab set + active, code folder, note, color, marker |
| **Substrate facts** — derived from processes | pane/window options written by hooks or derived by the daemon | by hooks | agent state, chat identity, git root, ports |
| **Viewer preferences** — how this device renders | browser storage or component-local state | no | theme, terminal font size, sidebar width/open, keybindings, macros, compose drafts, web-tab drafts, web zoom, **tile zoom / mobile single-tile choice**, divider ratios |
| **Navigation** — which tab this viewer is on | the URL route | *by intent only* (§ Viewer Behaviour) | `/$server/@N` |

Today's leak is class 1 living in class 3: `rk-layout:*`, `runkit-window-view:*`,
`runkit-window-panel:*`, `runkit-code-folder:*` are all per-browser keys
holding tab state (ratios and zoom stay local — they are reading postures). They move to `@rk_win_*` and the
localStorage keys die.

Why shared is *correct*, not a compromise: tmux already shares pane layout,
active pane, and window order across every attached client. Two people
attached to the same tmux window see the same panes. run-kit's per-viewer
layout was the deviation from the substrate it renders; this spec removes
the deviation. Mobile is handled by a **degradation rule**, not by separate
state (§ Layout in tmux).

---

## Addressing Grammar

One string, most-specific-wins, extending tmux's own:

```
[-L <server>] [=<session>:]@N[/<surface>[/<n>]]

@12              the tab
@12/web          the web surface of the tab
@12/web/2        web tab 2 inside it
@12/code         the code surface
-L fabKit1 =fabKit:@3/web/1
```

Rules:

- `@N` is mandatory when addressing a tab from outside it. Inside a pane,
  every verb defaults to **the caller's own tab** (`$TMUX_PANE` → `@N`, the
  `rk present` resolution) — the common agent case needs no address at all.
- Session/server qualifiers are exactly `rk mux`'s grammar (strict `%N/@N/=session:`);
  nothing fuzzy, no name-based window targets (a window name is a user label).
- Surfaces are addressed by *kind*, not by tile position. Position is a
  property of the layout (`@rk_win_layout`), so "slot A" is a layout
  question, never an address.
- Web tabs are **indexed, not named** — fewer round trips on the command line
  (`rk tab web rm 2`, not `rk tab web rm --name docs`). Titles are derived
  from the page and are display-only.

---

## The Option Inventory

Starting point: the scope-naming plan's target map (22 options → 21 after
`@rk_ctl_keepalive` deletes). This spec **adds** the rows marked *new*,
**renames** two, and **retires** one.

### Server (`@rk_srv_*`) — unchanged

`@rk_srv_session_order` · `@rk_srv_rank` · `@rk_srv_origin` · `@rk_srv_managed` · `@rk_srv_ephemeral` · `@rk_srv_protected`

### Session (`@rk_ses_*`) — unchanged

`@rk_ses_color` · `@rk_ses_flair` · `@rk_ses_pin_board` · `@rk_ses_pin_home` · `@rk_ses_pin_order`

### Window = tab (`@rk_win_*`)

| Option | Value | Writer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@rk_win_color` | color token | UI, agents | plan |
| `@rk_win_marker` / `@rk_win_flair` | marker/flair tokens | UI, agents | plan |
| `@rk_win_note` | `<epoch>:<text>` | agents, operator | plan |
| `@rk_win_role` | `operator` … | `rk role` | plan |
| **`@rk_win_layout`** | `<shape>:<surface>[,<surface>…]` e.g. `main-left:tty,code,web` | UI verbs, `rk tab layout`, agents | **new** — replaces `rk-layout:*` localStorage, `?layout=`, `?view=`, `?panel=` |
| **`@rk_win_web_<n>`** | URL (relative `/proxy/…`, `/present/{server}/{roothash}/…`, or absolute) | `rk tab web add`, UI address bar, `rk present` (sugar) | **new** — indexed set, `n ≥ 1`, dense (rm renumbers); present URLs are content-keyed (server + 12-hex sha256 of the root), the legacy `/present/{windowId}/{n}/…` slot form rides one release |
| **`@rk_win_web_<n>_root`** | absolute dir | `rk tab web add <file|dir>` | **new** — replaces `@rk_win_present_root`, now per web tab |
| **`@rk_win_web_active`** | `n` | UI tab strip, `rk tab web select` | **new** |
| **`@rk_win_code_root`** | absolute folder | first code-surface open (seed), code-server folder navigation, `rk tab code set` | **new** — replaces the `runkit-code-folder:*` localStorage latch |
| `@rk_win_url` | — | — | **retired** → `@rk_win_web_1` (migration row) |
| `@rk_win_present_root` | — | — | **retired** → `@rk_win_web_1_root` |
| `@rk_win_lens` (ex `@rk_type`) | — | — | **retired** — the "default view hint" (R5) is subsumed by `@rk_win_layout`; `rk present --window` writes `@rk_win_layout=single:web` instead |

### Pane (`@rk_pane_*`) — unchanged

`@rk_pane_agent_state` · `@rk_pane_chat`

### Option-value conventions

- Absent and empty read alike as "unset" (the `hasWebUrl` trim rule, generalized).
- Values are plain strings; **no JSON**. Multi-valued state is either an
  indexed family (`_web_<n>`) or a `:`/`,`-delimited scalar with a fixed
  grammar (`@rk_win_layout`). Every value must be writable by hand with one
  `tmux set-option -w` and readable with one `#{@…}` format.
- Every `@rk_win_*` row joins the **snapshot round-trip set** (`internal/snapshot`
  capture + restore); indexed families are captured by enumeration.
- Invalid values degrade, never error: an unknown shape or unavailable surface
  in `@rk_win_layout` degrades tile-by-tile toward `single:tty` at render
  time (the R2 fallback spirit) — the option is left as written so the author
  can see their mistake with `show-options`.

---

## Layout in tmux **[current]**

`@rk_win_layout` carries exactly what `?layout=` carried: **shape** (one of
the surface-layout presets — `single`, `split-h`, `split-v`, `row`, `col`,
`main-left`, `main-right`, `main-top`) and **order** (surfaces filling slots,
first = slot A). The preset set is unchanged and deliberately not a free
tree (surface-layout.md § Shape presets).

What moves into tmux, what does not:

| Layout value | Home | Why |
|---|---|---|
| shape | `@rk_win_layout` | agent-controllable, viewport-independent |
| order | `@rk_win_layout` | same |
| **zoom** (full-center one tile) | **per-viewer, localStorage** (`rk-layout-zoom:{server}:{@N}`) | decided 2026-08-28: zoom is a *reading posture*, like ratios — a phone zooming `web` must not zoom the desktop. An agent wanting one surface writes `single:<surface>` to the layout instead |
| **ratios** (divider positions) | **per-viewer, localStorage** (`rk-layout-ratios:*` stays) | viewport-dependent — a 40/60 split means different things at 1440px and 390px; tmux itself re-flows pane sizes per client width |

Every existing verb (Promote, Swap, Cycle shape, Close, rail toggles) becomes
a **write to `@rk_win_layout`** through `POST /api/windows/{id}/options`,
exactly like color and note today. The frontend holds no layout state of its
own; it renders the option and repaints on the SSE/`/ws/state` option tick.
The row-color safety-poll latency lesson applies: the POST handler must wake
the hub so a viewer's own click repaints immediately.

**Default.** Unset `@rk_win_layout` renders `single:tty`. The bare URL is the
deep link to the tab; there is nothing else to encode.

**Mobile degradation rule.** A coarse-pointer/narrow viewer renders **one
tile**: the viewer's local zoom if set, else slot A of the shared layout.
The mobile "switch-to-tile" verb writes the local zoom key only — it never
touches `@rk_win_layout`, so a phone user reading `web` leaves the desktop
viewer's arrangement alone. The *set* of tiles available to switch among is
the shared layout's order; adding a surface that is not in the layout goes
through the shared `--add` mutation like everywhere else.

**Deep links.** `?layout=` is **retired**. For one release the existing
route-entry shim translates old `?view=`/`?panel=`/`?layout=` links into a
one-shot write of `@rk_win_layout` (only when the option is unset; otherwise
the param is dropped and the shared layout wins). After that release the
param is ignored. The URL is always the bare route `/$server/@N`; "look at my
arrangement" is expressed as `rk tab layout @N …`, not as a link.

---

## Web Tabs **[current]**

**One `web` surface per tab; N web tabs inside it.** Chosen over "N web
surfaces per tab" because:

1. surface-layout v1 fixed *one tile per surface kind* and named the reason
   two web tiles were punted — distinct page addresses would have to become
   per-viewer state. With the address set in tmux the objection is gone, but
   the *layout encoding* still names kinds; web tabs keep it that way.
2. Two webviews in one tab would need a second arrangement model nested
   inside the first. Web tabs are a strip, not a layout.
3. Boards (surface-layout phase 4) tile surfaces across tabs; `@N/web/2` is
   addressable by a board tile for free.

State: `@rk_win_web_<n>` (URL), `@rk_win_web_<n>_root` (present root, file/dir
kinds only), `@rk_win_web_active`. **`n ≤ 8`** — the daemon reads window
options through `ListWindows`' fixed tmux format string (one call per server
per tick) and a format string cannot enumerate a family, so the URL slots are
spelled out `#{@rk_win_web_1}`…`#{@rk_win_web_8}`; roots stay out of the tick
(the `/present/{server}/{roothash}/*` handler reads the server's declared
roots at request time — one `list-windows -a` call over the eight
`_<n>_root` slots, sha256-prefix-matched — and the LEGACY
`/present/{windowId}/{n}/*` arm still reads `_<n>_root` directly with the
slot-1 `@rk_win_present_root` dual-read, one release). `web add` on a full
strip exits 1. The set is **dense and 1-based**. Removing tab 2 of 3
renumbers 3→2 and fixes up `_active`. Moving `n → m` permutes the URL and
`_root` companion as one pair; the intervening slots shift, and `_active`
follows the same tab identity to its new index. Renumbering is acceptable
because addresses are for commands, not for durable references — the same
trade tmux makes with window indices.

**Present URLs are content-keyed (decided 2026-09-01).** `rk present`
composes the `(server, roothash, path)` form — the tmux server name, a
12-hex sha256 prefix of the ABSOLUTE root directory, and the file's basename
(directory targets carry an empty path and serve the root's `index.html`):
`/present/{server}/{roothash}/{path}`. Resolution is derivation-only per
request (one `list-windows -a` over the 8 declared roots, unique
prefix-match against the URL's 8–64 hex segment, zero or more than one →
404); the declaration check is the anti-scanning property — an undeclared
root 404s with no file touched. The stored `@rk_win_web_<n>` value adopts
the same form (stored, iframe src, and copyable forms become one string
modulo origin and `?v=`). The legacy slot form
`/present/{windowId}/{n}/{path}?server=` serves unchanged for one release
(one handler, sniffed on the first segment's `^@[0-9]+$` shape); a stored
legacy URL is upgraded in place on re-present (WebAdd rewrites the slot to
the incoming new-form URL instead of `BumpVersion`-ing the legacy value).

Rendering: the tab strip always renders with the web tile — at an empty
family it is just the `+` (plus any viewer-local drafts), so the draft entry
points stay reachable from the empty state. Onboarding (no declared tabs) is
the empty-family CONTENT below the strip, not a stripless chrome variant.
Each declared web tab keeps its own iframe mounted (P3 — hide,
never unmount) so switching and reordering do not reload a dev server page.
Address-bar edits write `@rk_win_web_<active>`. Same-origin in-page
navigation updates the *display* only (as today) — the stored URL is the
tab's home, not its current location.

**Draft tabs are viewer-local.** The strip's new-tab affordances append an
ephemeral address-entry tab after the declared family. A draft has no URL and
therefore no `@N/web/<n>` address or tmux option; multiple viewers can hold
different drafts without changing shared state. Enter materializes the selected
draft through `web add` and selects the returned slot (including an existing
slot returned by idempotent add); Escape or the draft's close control discards
it. Drafts disappear when their window view unmounts.

**Identity is the URL, not the index (decided 2026-08-28).** `web add` is
idempotent on an identical resolved URL: it returns the existing index
instead of appending, and for file/dir kinds bumps that entry's `?v=`
cache-buster — which is exactly `rk present`'s re-present-is-refresh
contract, now falling out of the add verb. An agent that needs "my" web tab
back simply re-adds the same target; no durable ids, indices stay dense.

**Declared only (decided 2026-08-28).** Every member of the family is written
by someone. Ports detected on the tab's panes (`internal/ports`) are *not*
auto-materialised as web tabs — a derived member coming and going would
renumber declared ones under an agent's feet. Instead the strip offers a
detected port as a one-click **"+ add as web tab"** affordance (deferred —
needs per-window port attribution; tracked in `fab/backlog.md`), which is an
ordinary declared write.

**`rk present` is absorbed [current].** Its five target kinds and the `ProbePort`
step live on unchanged in `internal/present`; the verb becomes sugar:

```
rk present <target>               ≡  rk tab web add <target> --show
rk present --window[=name] <t>    ≡  rk tab new [--name] && rk tab web add <t> --layout single:web
```

`--show` = ensure `web` is in `@rk_win_layout` (grow through the ordinary
growth shapes) and set `_active` to the new index. The L3 "transient
auto-open carve-out" dies — auto-open is now just the layout write every
viewer renders.

---

## Code Surface + Code Bridge **[current]**

`@rk_win_code_root` replaces the per-browser latch. Seed rule unchanged:
written once, the first time the code surface renders for the tab, from the
derived git root; afterwards only code-server's own folder navigation (the
`load`-event seam) or an explicit `rk tab code set <folder>` moves it. The
terminal never moves it.

The code bridge already keys hosts by `folder` in `cb/hosts/<hostId>.json`.
With the folder in tmux, `rk code exec` gains a **tab-addressed form**:

```
rk code exec [--tab @N] <command> [args…]     # host = the one whose folder == @N's @rk_win_code_root
```

Default `--tab` is the caller's own tab, so an agent in a pane says
`rk code exec workbench.action.files.openFile $uri` and hits *its* editor.
Host resolution by cwd remains the fallback when the tab has no code root.
The bridge is thus the code surface's command channel exactly as
`set-option` is every other surface's — it is the one surface whose interior
(open files, cursor) is not tmux state and never will be.

---

## Viewer Behaviour — What Follows, What Doesn't

With tab state in tmux, "does the agent control the UI?" reduces to one
question: **which tab is the viewer on?**

| Agent action | Viewer on that tab | Viewer on another tab |
|---|---|---|
| any `@rk_win_*` write (layout, web add, code root, color…) | repaints on the next option tick | nothing visible beyond sidebar signals (color, marker, dot) |
| `rk tab new` | — | new row appears in the sidebar |
| "look at this" (`--notify`) | already looking | Web Push with a deep link, as `rk present --notify` today |

Navigation is deliberately **not** tmux state in v1. tmux's own "active
window" is per-session-per-client and run-kit's route is the analogue; an
agent that could yank every viewer's route would make the dashboard
unusable with two people or two agents. The nudge channel is push
notification + sidebar attention (right-panel P4: hidden must never mean
invisible-when-stuck).

Opt-in **follow mode** — a viewer toggles "follow session X" and their route
tracks the session's tmux active window (`select-window` from a pane then
navigates the follower) — is the natural v2 and needs no new option: it
reads a tmux fact that already exists.

---

## `rk tab` — The CLI Surface **[current]**

All verbs are thin: resolve address → one or two `set-option` (or
`new-window`) calls → print the resulting address on stdout (data), diagnostics
on stderr. They **work with `rk serve` down** (the `rk mux`/`rk present`
pattern — tmux is the store, the daemon is a renderer).

```
rk tab new [--session =S] [--cwd DIR] [--name N] [--layout L]      → prints @N
rk tab layout [@N] <shape>:<surface,…>                            # set
rk tab layout [@N] --add <surface> | --rm <surface> | --promote <surface> | --cycle
rk tab web add    [@N] <target> [--show]                           → prints @N/web/<n>
rk tab web rm     [@N/web/<n>]
rk tab web select [@N/web/<n>]
rk tab web mv     [@N/web/<n>] <m>                                  → prints @N/web/<m>
rk tab web ls     [@N]
rk tab code set   [@N] <folder>
rk tab show       [@N]                                             # dump every @rk_win_* of the tab
```

`--add/--rm/--promote/--cycle` are the same three layout mutations the UI
verbs perform (surface-layout § Verbs), so agent and human go through one
growth/collapse table. Address arguments accept the full grammar; omitted
`@N` means the caller's tab.

For `web mv`, the source accepts a bare index (`2`), a surface-relative
address (`web/2`), or the full tab address (`@N/web/2`). The destination is
always a bare 1-based index within the same window.

Placement (cli-layering.md): `rk tab` is substrate — it manipulates tmux
options and windows and knows nothing about pipelines. fab's `fab pane`
migration map may route "open the worker's tab with code on the right"
through it later.

## What Dies, What Stays

| Dies | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| `rk-layout:{server}:{@N}` localStorage | `@rk_win_layout` |
| `runkit-window-view:*`, `runkit-window-panel:*` (legacy of `?view=`/`?panel=`) | `@rk_win_layout` |
| `runkit-code-folder:*` latch | `@rk_win_code_root` |
| `?layout=`, `?view=`, `?panel=`; L1–L4 ladder | `@rk_win_layout`; one release of link translation, then bare routes only |
| `@rk_win_lens` / R5 default-view hint | `@rk_win_layout` |
| `@rk_win_url` + `@rk_win_present_root` | `@rk_win_web_1` + `@rk_win_web_1_root` |
| L3 present auto-open carve-out | `--show` writes the layout |
| `rk present` as a first-class verb | kept as sugar over `rk tab web add` |

| Stays |
|---|
| `rk-layout-ratios:*` (viewport-dependent) + the new per-viewer zoom key |
| every viewer preference key (theme, fonts, sidebar, keybindings, macros, drafts, web zoom) |
| the preset shape set, the verb table, the rail-as-toggle semantics |
| window-views R1 (availability derived), R3 (tty always reachable), R4 (one switcher), R6 (dot = current lens health) |

---

## Migration

Rides the scope-naming plan's `MigrateLegacyOptions` table (managed-conf
apply path, once per server per daemon lifetime, idempotent):

- `@rk_win_url` → `@rk_win_web_1`; `@rk_win_present_root` → `@rk_win_web_1_root`; set `_active=1` when `_web_1` exists.
- `@rk_win_lens=iframe` → `@rk_win_layout=single:web` (only when `_layout` unset), then unset `_lens`.
- localStorage → tmux is **client-side, one-shot, on route entry**: if the tab has no `@rk_win_layout` and this browser holds `rk-layout:{server}:{@N}`, POST it once, then delete the key. Same for the code-folder latch. Last browser to arrive wins on a never-visited tab — acceptable; it is the viewer's own last layout either way.
- Snapshot restore: the new rows enter the explicit option list; window ids remap as today.

---

## Open Questions

**Decided (2026-08-28)** — recorded so the reasoning survives:

- *Zoom is per-viewer.* Zoom and the mobile single-tile choice are reading
  postures, not tab state; they live in localStorage beside ratios. An
  agent that wants one surface writes `single:<surface>` to the layout.
- *Navigation is not tmux state (v1).* Agents nudge (push + sidebar
  attention), never move a viewer's route. Follow-mode is the v2 candidate.
- *`?layout=` dies.* One release of translation into a one-shot option
  write, then the URL is always the bare route.
- *Web-tab identity is the URL.* `web add` is idempotent on an identical
  URL (returns the index, bumps `?v=`); no ids (§ Web Tabs).
- *Web tabs are declared, never derived.* Detected ports become a one-click
  add affordance, not auto-members (§ Web Tabs).

**OQ1 — Ratios in tmux?** Percent ratios *could* be shared (`@rk_win_ratios`)
so an agent can say "code gets 70%". Deferred: viewport-dependence is real
and tmux's own model re-flows per client. Revisit when an agent actually
asks for it.

**OQ2 — Companions (`@rk_owner`).** Never shipped (no code references at
`67f4a553`). If revived it is one more `@rk_win_*` row (`@rk_win_owner`) and
`rk tab` must decide whether `@N` of a companion is a valid target. Keep the
right-panel.md section as a target note; nothing here depends on it.

**OQ3 — Boards.** A board is a layout of surfaces across tabs. With tab
state in tmux, does a board become `@rk_ses_pin_*` referencing `@N/<surface>`
addresses? Likely yes, and it would retire settings.yaml boards — out of
scope here, noted so nobody designs against it.
