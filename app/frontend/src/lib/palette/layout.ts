/**
 * Pure builder for the command-palette surface-layout actions (spec
 * docs/specs/surface-layout.md § Verbs: "every verb is also a palette
 * entry", Constitution V). Extracted from app.tsx so the per-state gating
 * (which adds/closes/verbs/templates are offered) is unit-testable without
 * mounting the shell — mirroring `lib/palette/view.ts` (`buildViewActions`).
 *
 * Entries, per current layout state:
 *  - `Tile: Show <Surface>`     — per AVAILABLE surface not open as a bare
 *                                 leaf (a kind present only as a foreign tile
 *                                 still gets its row — the add lands the bare
 *                                 slot); omitted when
 *                                 no split of the current tree fits the size
 *                                 floor (the rail's disabled buttons are the
 *                                 mouse mirror). "Show" is the honest
 *                                 verb: the entry reveals a renderer, it does
 *                                 not rearrange the layout. The split lands on
 *                                 the FOCUSED tile when the caller passes
 *                                 `focusedLeafId`; its direction resolves
 *                                 against the LIVE leaf rects when the caller
 *                                 passes them (desktop), the nominal box
 *                                 otherwise; the floor check estimates from the
 *                                 stored sizes when `layoutSizes` is threaded.
 *  - `Tile: Bring <window> <Surface> here` — per OTHER window on the route
 *                                 server × each of its lendable surfaces
 *                                 (never `gui`) not already in this layout,
 *                                 gated by the same floor as Show (the generic
 *                                 add rule inserts the foreign leaf). The write
 *                                 rides the caller's `onBring` seam (a plain
 *                                 apply or a borrow, by held state).
 *  - `Tile: Send Back to <home window>` — for the focused FOREIGN tile only;
 *                                 disabled when the home window is dead. The
 *                                 write rides the caller's `onSendBack` seam
 *                                 (the return endpoint recomputes both trees).
 *  - `Tile: Bring Back <Surface>` — the HOME tab's half of the return verb
 *                                 (the placeholder's bring back, palette
 *                                 form): one row per bare leaf whose kind is
 *                                 away (`awayIn[kind]` naming a LIVE holder).
 *                                 The write rides the caller's `onBringBack`
 *                                 seam with the holder window and the leaf
 *                                 address `@<this window>/<kind>`.
 *  - `Tile: Hide <Surface>`     — per open bare kind; omitted on a single-tile
 *                                 layout (the last tile never hides).
 *  - `Layout: Expand` / `Layout: Restore` — the transient focused-tile zoom
 *                                 toggle (desktop multi-tile only). Exactly one
 *                                 renders, keyed on the caller's `zoomed` state.
 *                                 "Zoom" is the CONTENT-magnification verb —
 *                                 tile-maximize's labels say Expand/Restore;
 *                                 the ids stay layout-zoom / layout-unzoom
 *                                 (they persist in user macros/overrides).
 *  - `Tile: Focus <Surface>`    — per open, not-currently-focused kind;
 *                                 keyboard parity for the pointer's
 *                                 click-to-focus. Desktop multi-tile only (the
 *                                 caller passes `onFocus` only then). Duplicate
 *                                 kinds (two tty tiles) yield one entry — the
 *                                 seam focuses the first leaf of the kind.
 *  - `Layout: Promote <Surface>` — per open leaf except slot A (promoting
 *                                 the template's main tile is a no-op, so its
 *                                 entry is omitted). Bare kinds dedupe to one
 *                                 row (the kind is the first leaf's id); a
 *                                 foreign tile gets its own row labelled by
 *                                 its `@N/<kind>` address.
 *  - `Tile: Swap Left|Right|Up|Down` — for the FOCUSED tile, one row per
 *                                 direction in which a geometric neighbour
 *                                 exists. Desktop multi-tile only: the caller
 *                                 passes `leafRects` and `focusedLeafId` only
 *                                 then.
 *  - `Layout: <Template>`       — one per `templatesFor(n)` at the current
 *                                 tile count (the ▦ chip rows' palette form);
 *                                 a template whose result lands under the size
 *                                 floor is not offered.
 *  - `Layout: Cycle Template`   — the ⌘; chord's palette body; its id
 *                                 `layout-cycle` IS the registry actionId, so
 *                                 `withShortcutHints` decorates it with the
 *                                 effective combo (shortcuts are documented in
 *                                 the palette registration). Omitted at one
 *                                 tile (the template ring is empty).
 *
 * The `code-toggle` chord (⌘2/⇧Ctrl+2) toggles the code surface's tile; that
 * surface's Show/Hide entry carries its effective combo
 * (`toggleTarget`/`toggleShortcut`, generalised to `toggleHints`) so the
 * chord stays discoverable.
