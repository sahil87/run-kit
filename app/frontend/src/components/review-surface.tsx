/**
 * ReviewSurface — the `review` tile: the window's pull request rendered the way
 * GitHub's "Files changed" tab does, plus the comment listener's arm switch
 * (spec `docs/specs/pr-review.md`).
 *
 * The surface is **PR-backed only**. Availability is decided upstream by
 * `hasReview` (the window's branch-derived `prUrl`), so this component renders
 * only for a window that HAS a PR; what it selects between are the CONTENT
 * states — loading, unreachable gh, an empty diff, and the live list. That is
 * the same availability-vs-reachability split the `code` surface uses.
 *
 * **The file list is virtualized, the diff body is not** (§ R7): one file's diff
 * is bounded by that file, but the number of files in a PR is not, so only the
 * rows near the viewport are mounted and each file's body is fetched lazily on
 * expand.
 *
 * Refreshes are event-driven, never polled: the tile loads on mount, on a
 * window/PR change, on the SSE tick's unhandled-thread digest changing, and on
 * the explicit refresh verb. There is no `setInterval` anywhere in the surface.
