// Package prstatus maintains an in-memory, periodically-refreshed cache of the
// current user's open pull-request statuses, fetched in a single batched `gh`
// call. It is modeled on internal/metrics.Collector: a background goroutine
// ticks on an interval, refreshes a snapshot under a lock, and Snapshot()
// hands callers a deep copy.
//
// Design (see fab/changes/260610-596o-pr-status-sidebar):
//   - ONE batched GraphQL call (gh api graphql, viewer.pullRequests) fetches
//     every open PR authored by the user across ALL repos — O(1) in PR count.
//   - The map is REBUILT WHOLESALE each refresh. A PR that merged/closed (no
//     longer OPEN) simply drops out next cycle — this is the cleanup mechanism,
//     so there is no eviction logic or window-lifecycle hook.
//   - On a gh error (network blip) the last-good map is kept
//     (stale-while-revalidate), mirroring metrics.Collector / fetchPaneMapCached.
//   - gh absent or unauthenticated is a silent no-op (last-good kept), matching
//     the `command -v rk` fail-silent posture used elsewhere in the codebase.
//
// Runtime state is in-memory only. Since 260809-r4vk the last-good state is ALSO
// mirrored to one droppable startup-seed file (prstatus_disk.go) so a restart
// while gh is slow/offline does not start blank; that cache is never
// authoritative and is covered by Constitution §II's $XDG_STATE_HOME/rk/
// carve-out. No tmux option, no database.
// All process execution uses exec.CommandContext with a timeout and an explicit
// argument slice; no shell string and no user input in argv (Constitution §I).
