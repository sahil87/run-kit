// rk mux — the tmux-substrate command family (docs/specs/cli-layering.md):
// operations that talk to tmux directly from the caller's context, with no
// daemon dependency. Thirteen members in two tiers, presented in three help
// groups (messaging / pane mechanics / server ops — the discoverability
// grouping docs/specs/agent-messaging.md settles). The pane-scoped tier takes the
// family's strict target grammar: `send` (deliver a message into an agent
// pane, gated on its @rk_agent_state) and `await` (block until a pane's agent
// state or a file signal fires) are the messaging pair; `capture` (scrollback
// capture with substrate-only enrichment), `kill` (agent-state-gated pane
// removal), and `process` (the pane's process tree with agent cross-check) are
// the substrate twins; `panes` and `sessions` are the server-wide enumeration
// queries — one row per pane / per session (with the name-derived role), no
// target. The operator tier: `new` creates a detached tmux
// server on a named socket, optionally marked @rk_ephemeral for the reap
// sweep; `adopt` converts an external server to rk-managed (stamp @rk_srv_managed,
// source the managed conf); `reap` is the operator-invoked janitor for leaked
// test servers; `snapshot` inspects and restores layout
// snapshots; `init-conf` scaffolds the tmux config; `guard` fronts the real
// tmux binary, refusing bare `kill-server` — the verb the installed PATH shim
// execs (tmux_guard.go). The old root-level forms (reaper, snapshot,
// init-conf) survive as hidden deprecation aliases at the root (reaper.go /
// snapshot.go / initconf.go); tmux-guard survives as a PERMANENT hidden alias
// (installed shims exec the literal name — see tmuxGuardAliasCmd).
//
// The family parent carries the shared persistent -L/--server flag (the
// `fab pane` pattern): every subcommand inherits it, but only the pane-scoped
// verbs and the `panes`/`sessions` enumerations consume it — the operator members reject
// an explicitly-set -L via
// muxRejectInheritedServerFlag rather than silently ignore it. `guard` is the
// exception: DisableFlagParsing means nothing is parsed and -L/-S flow
// verbatim into the tmux argv, where they are genuinely tmux's socket flags —
// so it does not call muxRejectInheritedServerFlag. Server resolution order:
// -L wins, else the caller's own server derived from the original $TMUX
// (socket basename — the same name ListServers and the -L primitives use),
// else the default server.
