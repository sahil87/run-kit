# session-reorder.spec.ts

End-to-end coverage for the server-persisted sidebar session order. Verifies
the backend → tmux user-option → SSE → frontend render path lines up, and
that the persisted order survives a page reload (the order lives in tmux,
not the browser). Drag simulation is intentionally NOT used — Playwright's
HTML5 DnD simulation is fragile, and the contract under test is "whatever
the server has, the sidebar shows," not the drag mechanics themselves.

## Shared setup

- Spawns three named tmux sessions on the e2e tmux server (`rk-e2e` by default,
  overridable via `E2E_TMUX_SERVER`): `reorder-alpha-{ts}`, `reorder-bravo-{ts}`,
  `reorder-charlie-{ts}`.
- `afterAll` kills the sessions and unsets `@rk_session_order` to leave the
  server clean for the next run.

## Tests

### server-persisted order survives a page reload via SSE

**What it proves**: An order persisted via `PUT /api/sessions/order` is
delivered to the sidebar via the eager SSE `session-order` broadcast and
survives a page reload (re-delivered on connect via the cached snapshot).
This exercises the full production path — the same one the drag UI uses.

**Steps**:

1. Build the desired custom order: `[charlie, alpha, bravo]`.
2. Send `PUT /api/sessions/order?server={TMUX_SERVER}` with body
   `{"order": [charlie, alpha, bravo]}`. Assert the response is OK.
3. Navigate to `/{TMUX_SERVER}` and wait for "Connected".
4. Wait for all three test sessions to render in the sidebar.
5. Use `expect.poll` to read the rendered order (collected from each session
   row's `aria-label='Navigate to {name}'` button, in DOM order, filtered
   to the three test sessions). Assert it matches `[charlie, alpha, bravo]`.
   `expect.poll` covers the SSE→React-state propagation lag without committing
   to a fixed sleep.
6. Reload the page and wait for "Connected" + all sessions visible.
7. Re-poll the order and assert it still matches `[charlie, alpha, bravo]` —
   reload does not affect the persisted order.
