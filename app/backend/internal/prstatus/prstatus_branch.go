// Branch→PR derivation (260705-dmex-generic-agent-state-tier).
//
// This is a distinct capability from the viewer-wide collector above: given a
// pane's repo directory and branch, it resolves the PR whose head is that branch
// via `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` run in the repo, picking by
// precedence (open > merged > closed — pickBranchPR). run-kit derives
// PrURL/PrNumber this way for ANY pane on a branch with a PR — not only
// fab-change-bound windows — replacing the pane-map join as the PR-link source
// (Constitution §X: PR links are derivable, not pushed). The viewer-wide
// URL-keyed collector still supplies the live state/checks/review join, keyed by
// the derived URL.
//
// Querying ALL states (not just open) is what makes a merged PR's purple/orange
// done-square DURABLE and RESTART-PROOF: the PR keeps resolving positive after it
// merges, derived freshly from gh each pass, so there is no in-memory grace clock
// to expire or to be wiped by an rk restart (status-pyramid.md § Open Decisions
// D2, revised — the earlier `--state open` + 10-min grace decayed the merged
// square into a green fab square minutes after merge).
//
// CRITICAL — no network on the SSE hot path. Resolution runs on a BACKGROUND
// refresher (mirroring Collector.Start's tick discipline), NOT inline in
// FetchSessions. The sessions enrichment loop only (a) REGISTERS the observed
// (repoDir, branch) pairs — a cheap, lock-guarded set insert — and (b) JOINS the
// derived PR from an in-memory snapshot. All gh subprocesses live on the
// refresher goroutine, so the 2.5s SSE poll never spawns a process. This
// preserves api/sse.go's documented zero-network-call hot-path invariant and
// code-review.md's 5s API cap.
//
// Cold start (260807-2ept-pr-status-cold-start). Two mechanisms make the first
// useful pass fast, without touching the 30s steady-state cadence:
//
//   - REGISTRATION WAKE. Start's immediate first refresh is a no-op at process
//     start (no pair is registered until the SSE enrichment loop has run), so the
//     first useful pass used to wait out a whole 30s tick. Register now signals a
//     coalescing wake channel on FIRST-SIGHT pairs only, and Start's loop debounces
//     it (branchPRWakeDebounce) so one SSE pass's burst of registrations triggers
//     ONE refresh — event-driven, ~2.5s after start.
//   - VIEWER HEAD-INDEX. The viewer-wide Collector's single batched GraphQL call
//     already fetches every recent PR the user authored, including each one's head
//     repository + ref. StoreViewerIndex keeps that as a
//     (host/owner/name, branch) → candidates index, and each pass JOINS against it
//     before falling back to `gh pr list` for misses only. Most observed pairs are
//     the user's own PRs, so a pass costs ~0 subprocesses instead of one per pair —
//     fixing both the cold-start latency and the O(N)-subprocess steady-state
//     volume. Identity is HOST-QUALIFIED so a gitlab/GHE pane can never join a
//     same-`owner/name` github.com PR.
//
// The two mechanisms wake the SAME channel: whichever of the two racing startup
// events lands second (the SSE registrations or the collector's first batched
// fetch) triggers the debounced pass, so cold start never depends on wiring order.
//
// An index miss is never an authoritative negative (the batch covers only
// viewer-authored PRs within its top-prFetchLimit window), so only the gh
// fallback or the default-branch exclusion may clear an entry.
//
// All subprocess execution uses exec.CommandContext with an explicit argv slice
// and a timeout; no shell string, no user input in argv beyond the branch name,
// which is passed as a discrete arg (Constitution §I).
