// rk tmux-guard — a PATH-shim guard that fronts the real tmux binary. Agents
// running inside run-kit-managed tmux panes have killed the host tmux server
// four documented times; the fatal command shape is `tmux kill-server` without
// an explicit socket. tmux socket resolution is -L/-S > $TMUX > TMUX_TMPDIR,
// so inside a pane even `TMUX_TMPDIR=… tmux kill-server` routes to the HOST
// server ($TMUX wins). Prose guidance (CLAUDE.md, agent memory) has failed to
// prevent this; the guard is the deterministic, harness-agnostic veto.
//
// `rk agent-setup` installs a shim at ~/.local/share/rk/shims/tmux that execs
// `rk tmux-guard "$@"` (see agent_setup.go), and prepends that directory to
// PATH via a marker-owned block in the user's shell startup files. Every
// PATH-resolved `tmux …` then flows through here:
//
//   - Block rule (v1): an invocation whose command chain includes kill-server
//     and carries NO explicit -L/-S refuses to exec, exits 1, and explains the
//     resolution-precedence trap. The block applies whether or not $TMUX is
//     set — a bare kill-server with $TMUX unset targets the DEFAULT host
//     server, which is equally destructive. Explicit -L/-S always passes
//     (including -L naming the host server): the guard enforces explicitness,
//     not policy. Scoped kills (kill-session/-window/-pane) are never blocked.
//   - Pass rule: everything else execs the real tmux verbatim via a
//     process-replacing exec (syscall.Exec) with the original argv slice and
//     environment — preserving argv, stdio/TTY, signals, and exit code. The
//     env has $TMUX restored from tmux.OriginalTMUX (internal/tmux's init()
//     strips it process-wide — see tmuxGuardExecEnv).
//     Constitution §I note: exec.CommandContext is deliberately NOT used here —
//     the guard is a transparent wrapper around frequently long-lived
//     interactive clients (attach), where any timeout is wrong by construction
//     and a supervising relay would break TTY/signal semantics. The §I
//     substance is kept: an explicit argument slice, no shell string, nothing
//     user-interpolated.
//   - Escape hatch: RK_TMUX_GUARD=off disables the guard for that invocation
//     (exec passthrough, no message), so deliberate host teardown stays
//     possible without uninstalling. The variable is stripped from the exec'd
//     env so the hatch never outlives its invocation (see tmuxGuardExecEnv —
//     tmux would otherwise bake it into a newly started server's global
//     environment).
//
// Absolute-path invocations (/usr/bin/tmux …) bypass PATH and are out of scope
// — the shim targets the accidental case, which is how all four deaths
// happened.

// shim cannot break tmux in a shell where rk is off PATH at fire time,
// mirroring the agent-state hook's stable-path rationale. The path sits inside
// double quotes, so it MUST be pre-validated by validateHookPath (rejects
// ' " $ ` \); every other interpolated value is a compile-time constant, so
// nothing environment-derived is unvalidated (Constitution §I).
//
// The script is self-healing rather than a single exec, because the embedded
// path is only as stable as the package manager's symlink:
//
//   - Probe: when the rk path is not executable, poll it (see the probe
//     constants above) so an invocation landing inside an upgrade's relink
//     window stalls instead of exiting 127. An executable rk is tested once
//     and never sleeps, so the steady state is unchanged.
//   - Fail OPEN: after the budget, resolve the real tmux with a PATH walk
//     mirroring findRealTmux's exclusions and exec it. The guard catches
//     ACCIDENTAL kill-server; the chance of one firing inside a few-second
//     window is negligible next to the certainty of breaking every tmux caller
//     on the machine at every upgrade. Availability wins. The shell sniff is
//     deliberately MORE conservative than sniffsAsTmuxShim: it scans the whole
//     candidate rather than a 512-byte head, and skips any candidate it cannot
//     verify — a false skip degrades to a clear "no real tmux" error, while a
//     false accept would exec a relocated copy of this script and fork-loop.
//   - Backstop: before failing open, refuse the literal bare-kill-server shape
//     (a flat token scan, RK_TMUX_GUARD=off honored). Over- and under-blocking
//     are both acceptable on a path that only runs while rk is unreachable;
//     porting tmuxGuardBlocks to shell is not.
//
// Line order is load-bearing: tmuxShimExecTarget parses the FIRST exec line,

//
// Environment hygiene is load-bearing too. Every shell variable is _rk_-prefixed
// and unset before each exec, because POSIX sh keeps the export attribute when

// environment into a new server's GLOBAL environment, so forwarding the hatch
