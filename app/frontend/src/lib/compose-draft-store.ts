/**
 * Module-level, per-target draft store for the docked compose strip
 * (260718-dhdj; per-target keying + persistence 260801-cyth).
 *
 * Drafts are keyed by their SEND TARGET — `entryKey(server, windowId)` from
 * `@/store/window-store`, the same key the strip's `focusedKey()` computes — so
 * a draft stays with its addressee instead of traveling with the user across
 * routes or board pane-focus changes. The strip resolves the key from the live
 * focused target each render; with no target it is disabled and shows the
 * stable empty draft.
 *
 * The store lives at module scope (not component state) because the strip is
 * *mounted conditionally* in two separate footers (`app.tsx`'s AppShell and
 * `board-page.tsx`), gated on the `composeStripEnabled` chrome preference —
 * component-local `useState` would destroy unsent drafts on toggle-off and on
 * terminal↔board route changes. It is exposed through a `useSyncExternalStore`
 * seam — the same module-store pattern as the window-switch pending mask
 * (`window-transition.ts`): a module map + a listener set +
 * `getSnapshot`/`subscribe`, notify-only-on-change, with a STABLE snapshot
 * object per key while that key's draft is unchanged.
 *
 * Persistence: draft TEXT survives page refreshes via one localStorage key
 * (`runkit-compose-drafts`, a JSON map `{[entryKey]: {text, updatedAt}}`),
 * written through synchronously on every commit and hydrated tolerantly at
 * module load (malformed content degrades to empty — the `parseOverrides`
 * posture from `keybindings.ts`). Writes prune: empty-text entries are never
 * stored, entries outside the `MAX_DRAFT_AGE_MS` window (stale — or
 * future-dated by clock skew) are dropped, and only the
 * `MAX_PERSISTED_DRAFTS` newest (by `updatedAt`) are kept — tmux window IDs
 * are reused after a server restart, so stale drafts must age out. Multi-tab
 * is last-write-wins (no `storage`-event sync).
 *
 * Attachments (`File` objects) cannot reach localStorage, so they stay
 * in-memory per key and die on refresh — a cosmetic loss: uploads are eager
 * (already on the target worktree's disk) and their path lines live in the
 * persisted text, so sending still works after a reload. Blob URLs for
 * previews are derived per-mount from the retained `File` objects.
 *
 * SENT-HISTORY (260806-kadm) — a second, independent per-target map living in
 * this same module (so the `entryKey` coupling and the persistence discipline
 * stay in one place). Sending clears the draft unconditionally and delivery is
 * unverifiable at all three hops (queued `ws.send`, an ignored PTY write error,
 * a pane app that swallows the bytes), so every transmitted text is recorded
 * here and the strip's ↑ walks back through it. Recovery over verification.
 *
 * It rides a SIBLING localStorage key (`runkit-compose-sent-history`) rather
 * than folding into the draft schema: the shipped draft parser and prune
 * pipeline stay byte-compatible, and neither surface's corruption can take the
 * other down. Same posture otherwise — write-through on every push, tolerant
 * parse at module load, and the same age/cap pruning (window IDs are reused
 * after a tmux server restart, so stale history must not resurrect against a
 * stranger window).
