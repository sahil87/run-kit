// The Pane panel's live PR-status row: it renders for a change-bound window
// that has a PR and is hidden for a scratch window, at both mobile and
// desktop viewports. PR status renders in the Pane panel (the per-window
// metadata panel in the sidebar), NOT on the window-tree rows — so each
// assertion first selects the target window, then reads the Pane panel.
//
// This spec is fully mocked: the isolated e2e tmux server has no real
// change-bound PRs and `gh` is unavailable in CI, so we inject the SSE
// `sessions` payload (and the server list) via page.route. That lets us
// exercise the frontend display gate deterministically without any network or
// gh dependency.
//
// Shared setup: **/api/servers → a single server `default` (so the app
// attaches exactly one state-socket connection); /ws/state (via
// mockStateSocket) carries session `dev` with two windows — @1
// "feature-work" (change-bound, with prNumber 386, prUrl, prState open,
// prChecks pass, prReview approved — the gate satisfied; @1 is the active
// window, so the Pane panel reflects it on load) and @2 "scratch-shell" (no
// fabChange — the gate fails). beforeEach installs both routes before
// navigation and seeds localStorage['runkit-sidebar-section-pane'] = 'true'
// via addInitScript — the Pane panel is visibility-gated and defaults OFF,
// and the seed re-runs on every navigation, keeping the panel mounted through
// the in-test goto sequences.

// One change-bound window with a PR (gate satisfied) and one scratch window
// with NO fabChange (gate fails — PR row must be absent even if a prNumber
// were present). The change-bound window carries prState/prChecks/prReview as
// the backend SSE join would attach them.
