// no webServer block and no baseURL here; specs build URLs from E2E_PORT
// (the frontend config's fail-closed 3333 fallback applies to bare runs).
// workers is 1 because the lane is single-rig by construction: one tmux
// server, one seeded two-host hosts.json, one shell instance per test.
// The specs import the frontend's `_tmux` fixture only (node builtins) —
// never `_ready.ts`, which imports `@playwright/test`: Playwright refuses
// two physical copies of itself in one process, so a second copy (the
// frontend's own install) must never load here.
