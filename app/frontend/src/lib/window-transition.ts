/**
 * First-inbound-bytes gate for the polished capture (260703-l4nf).
 *
 * The transition wrapper in `app.tsx` opens a gate (`beginWindowSwitchGate`)
 * before navigating, then `await`s `waitForFirstWrite()` inside
 * `startViewTransition`'s async callback so the new-state snapshot is captured
 * only once the incoming window has received its first bytes. `TerminalClient`
 * calls `notifyFirstWrite()` at message-receipt time (inside `ws.onmessage`,
 * before the write/coalesce decision), which releases the gate. Receipt time,
 * not write time: `startViewTransition` suppresses rendering while its callback
 * runs and rAF callbacks do not fire during suppression, so a release keyed off
 * the (rAF-scheduled) coalesced flush would never fire during the transition.
 *
 * The gate handles three concurrency subtleties:
 *
 * 1. **Rapid switching does not serialize.** Per the View Transitions spec, a
 *    second `startViewTransition` started while one is in flight queues its
 *    update callback BEHIND the first callback's returned promise. The first
 *    callback holds that promise open for up to the timeout (it `await`s the
 *    gate), so a second switch's navigation would stall behind the first's full
 *    timeout. `beginWindowSwitchGate` therefore FIRES (resolves) any still-
 *    pending prior gate immediately on supersession, so the first callback
 *    returns at once and the browser runs the queued second callback without
 *    delay.
 *
 * 2. **Only the INCOMING window's bytes release the gate.** A same-session
 *    switch rides the existing WebSocket with no reconnect, so a busy OUTGOING
 *    window can still be streaming bytes when the switch fires; those would
 *    release the gate before tmux has even run `select-window`. The gate stays
 *    closed to `notify` until `openForNotify()` is called, which the wrapper
 *    does only after the `selectWindow` POST resolves — so a byte only counts
 *    once tmux has been told to switch. The wrapper does NOT `await` the POST
 *    before starting the wait: it CHAINS `openForNotify` off the POST
 *    (`posted.then(() => gate.openForNotify())`) and awaits only
 *    `waitForFirstWrite()`, whose timeout clock starts at the wait (callback
 *    entry), not after the POST. So the callback's total duration is hard-capped
 *    at the timeout regardless of the POST's fate — a stalled `selectWindow`
 *    (no client-side fetch timeout) cannot freeze the document past the ~300ms
 *    budget, and a rapid second switch never queues behind a stalled POST.
 *    Bytes that arrive before the POST resolves are ignored, so if the POST is
 *    slow the gate simply times out ungated (today's behavior plus motion)
 *    rather than releasing on a stale outgoing byte.
 *
 * 3. **A stale timer does not clobber a newer gate.** Each gate is a distinct
 *    token; `settleGate` clears the module slot only when it still points at its
 *    own token, so a late timeout from a superseded gate can neither resolve
 *    nor disarm the current one.
 *
 * A single module-level slot is sufficient: at any moment there is exactly one
 * focused terminal and at most one gate the wrapper is awaiting (a superseding
 * `beginWindowSwitchGate` fires the previous one). `notify` is a cheap no-op
 * when no gate is open for it, so terminal receipts outside a transition are
 * free.
