/**
 * Pure builder for the command-palette window-view lens actions (`View: Web` /
 * `View: Terminal` / `View: Code`). Extracted from app.tsx so
 * the visibility gating (available AND not-current) and label composition are
 * unit-testable without mounting the whole shell — mirroring lib/palette/move.ts
 * / lib/palette/update.ts. The action bodies are thin `onSelect` wrappers passed
 * in by the caller (they call `switchView(v)`).
 *
 * Constitution V palette parity: the palette is the ONLY desktop lens-switch
 * surface — no chord reaches a single-tile lens switch (the ⌘1/⌘2/⌘3 digits
 * are TILE toggles, a different action), so every entry carries an empty
 * `shortcut`. Each lens is offered only when it is AVAILABLE for the current
 * window AND is not the current view, so the palette shows the destination,
 * never the current lens.
