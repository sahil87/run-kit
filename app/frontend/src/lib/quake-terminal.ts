/**
 * Quake terminal support — pure helpers for the pull-down quake terminal
 * overlay (components/quake-terminal.tsx) plus its entry-point seams:
 *
 *  - `resolveQuakeServer` — the server-context rule: the route's server on
 *    Server/Terminal routes; on Host/Board the sole server when exactly one
 *    exists, else the most recently viewed server (then the first) as the
 *    picker default.
 *  - `findOperatorWindow` — client-side operator discovery from the sessions
 *    payload (`role === "operator"` — server-scoped radio, enforced
 *    backend-side, so the first hit is the only hit).
 *  - `shouldShowAskOperatorRow` — the palette free-text fallback gate: zero
 *    action matches + an operator on the resolved server + a trimmed query at
 *    or above the length floor (short typo fragments never fire a send).
 *  - `requestQuakeTerminal` — the document-event seam every entry point
 *    (chord dispatch, palette action, overflow-menu row, palette fallback row,
 *    mobile tongue) funnels through
 *    to the single layout-mounted quake terminal, which forks on form factor:
 *    desktop drives the ⌘J machine, mobile navigates to the operator
 *    window's terminal route. An event, not a callback chain: the entry
 *    points live in route shells the layout does not compose directly. The
 *    request is buffered until the quake terminal handles it, so a dispatch
 *    fired before the lazy quake terminal mounts is drained on mount rather
 *    than lost.
 *  - The ⌘J two-state machine (`rest | open`, focus and drawer linked) — the
 *    desktop quake terminal's controlling state, shared between the top-bar
 *    quake launcher and the drawer (module slot, the open-state idiom).
 *  - The shared compose seam (`useOperatorCompose` + `sendOperatorMessage` +
 *    `attachOperatorFiles`) — ONE draft/send/upload implementation driving the
 *    desktop quake launcher (the quake terminal's only input; the drawer is
 *    output-only).
 *  - The chat-subject store (`setOperatorChatSubject` + `useOperatorChatChip`)
 *    — the templated chat lane's context: on a terminal route the quake
 *    terminal stamps the route window here (the validated `?from=` origin on
 *    the operator window's own route), the quake launcher and the operator
 *    route's compose strip render the dismissable chip from it, and
 *    `sendOperatorMessage` (plus the strip's plain-submit path) reads it AT
 *    SEND TIME to fork between the templated lane (`sendOperatorRequest(...,
 *    "user-message", ...)` — a server-derived source envelope wraps the text;
 *    the busy gate and queue are skipped server-side) and the direct
 *    `sendToWindow` lane.
 *  - Per-viewer persisted preferences (geometry, opacity) — localStorage
 *    stores with the in-module pub/sub idiom (`use-local-storage-enum.ts`).
 *  - The quake-terminal-origin event predicate and `useQuakeTerminalContext` —
 *    the read-only server/target resolution the quake launcher and mobile
 *    tongue share with the quake terminal.
