/**
 * Popout-window pure logic — the `shell:popout` payload validator, the
 * popout-registry dedupe decision, and the `?pop=` strip for New Window
 * duplication.
 *
 * A popout is a same-host shell window opened by the SPA's Pop out verb: the
 * payload carries a ROUTE REMAINDER (`pathname + search`, e.g.
 * `/rk-dev/@12?pop=web`), never an absolute URL — main resolves it against
 * the sender host's origin, so a cross-origin target is unrepresentable and
 * the window-open policy's all-external rule stays untouched.
 *
 * Deliberately electron-free (the `window-open.ts` / `window-registry.ts`
 * pattern), so the sibling `popout.test.ts` covers every accept/reject case
 * under plain `node --test`. The impure glue — `screen.getPrimaryDisplay()`
 * for the size ceiling, BrowserWindow construction, focus — lives in
 * `main.ts`.
