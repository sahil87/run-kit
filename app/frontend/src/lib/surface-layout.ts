/**
 * Pure helpers for the surface-layout model (spec docs/specs/surface-layout.md).
 *
 * The terminal route's center is a LAYOUT MANAGER: one or more tiles (offers
 * gated by a per-viewport size floor, never a tile count), each
 * rendering a surface (a (substrate, lens) pair), arranged as a canonical
 * split TREE (`lib/layout-tree.ts`) with per-viewer divider SIZES. The tree
 * is shared tab state: it rides the `@rk_win_layout` window option in the
 * window payload (tree form; the legacy preset strings parse permanently),
 * and `effectiveLayout` is its only read (parse + degrade, never a rewrite).
 * Sizes and the zoomed surface are per-viewer localStorage state, never in
 * the URL. This module owns availability degradation, the tree verbs behind
 * the tile verbs, the sizes/zoom storage wrappers, and the one-release
 * inbound-only translation input for the retired `?view=` / `?panel=`
 * params (and their localStorage predecessors).
 *
 * Everything here mirrors the shipped `window-view.ts` / `right-panel.ts`
 * pattern: pure and DOM-free except thin try/catch-noop localStorage
 * wrappers, so the render branch in `app.tsx` AND the unit tests share one
 * drift-free source. Availability reuses `window-view.ts`'s capability
 * helpers (`hasCode`) as the single source — `tty` and `web` are
 * the always-available surfaces (the muxed relay supports N clients per pane,
 * so duplicate tty tiles of one window are legal; web's empty-URL content is
 * the onboarding state, so the lens always exists).
