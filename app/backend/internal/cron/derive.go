// CALLING the evaluator's own primitives (JoinAnchor, Ladder.NextFire,
// everyAnchor, cronScheduleDue, LastDelivery, robfig Schedule.Next) so the
// projection can never diverge from the tick's math. Orphaned is a live
// per-call snapshot of target resolution; OrphanedSince/ExpiresAt surface the
// orphan.go streak derivation behind the same snapshot.
