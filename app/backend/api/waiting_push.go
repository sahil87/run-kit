// Web Push on sustained waiting (260706-y1ar; status-pyramid.md § Attention
// Propagation — the Web Push row). When a window's rolled-up agentState has been
// `waiting` (an agent blocked on a HUMAN — the most notification-worthy state)
// sustained for at least waitingPushSustain, send exactly ONE push per waiting
// episode. `idle`/`active` never push.
//
// Episode model: a waiting EPISODE is a maximal run of consecutive `waiting`
// ticks for one window. The tracker stamps when a window first entered its
// current waiting run, and whether that episode has already pushed. It pushes
// once the run has lasted >= the sustain threshold; any non-waiting tick clears
// the run so the NEXT `waiting` starts a fresh episode that can push again
// (re-arm on state change). This is poll-derived, in-memory only — no durable
// store beyond the hub's episode map (Constitution II applies to durable state;
// this mirrors the in-memory prstatus/metrics collectors). It rides the SSE
// per-tick assembly seam where the rolled-up window state already exists — no
// new goroutine, no new poller.

	// waitingPushSustain is how long a window must stay `waiting` before its one
