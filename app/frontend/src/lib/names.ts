 * Per-kind safe-name transforms applied LIVE in every naming input's onChange

 * type, so the optimistic-update name is identical to the committed name
 * (WYSIWYG). The backend stays reject-only — these transforms steer input to
 * the charset the backend's tightened new-name validation accepts.
 *
 * Shape shared by all transforms: unsafe chars CONVERT to "_" (never strip —
 * stripping silently shortens names and loses word boundaries), consecutive
 * converted chars collapse to one "_", leading separators drop as typed (a
 * space pressed in an empty field produces nothing), case is preserved, and
 * length caps live at the backend maxima. A TRAILING "_" deliberately stays
 * visible while typing — trimming it live would delete the separator the user
 * just typed ("My " + "p" would become "Myp") — and is trimmed only at commit
 * via `finalizeSafeName`.
