/**

 * badge-count and theme-color caches that the switch seam repaints from, the
 * cross-window badge aggregation, and the load-failure flag transitions the
 * remote-tunnel heal gates its reload on.
 *
 * Deliberately electron-free (the `hosts.ts` / `window-open.ts` /
 * `local-daemon.ts` / `update-check.ts` / `strip.ts` / `badge.ts` precedent):
 * the actual `WebContentsView` is an opaque generic handle `H`, so the
 * sibling `views.test.ts` covers the decision logic under plain
 * `node --test`. The impure glue — view construction, attach/detach on a
 * window's contentView, `setBounds`, `setTitleBarOverlay`, badge painting —
 * lives in `main.ts`.
 *
 * Identity: entries key on (windowId, hostId) — the same host may show in N
 * windows (each an independent view; views never migrate between windows),
 * and several host entries may share one ORIGIN, so origin is never a key
 * here. `webContentsId` is carried so IPC reports (`badge:set`), whose
 * sender is a webContents, resolve to their view without an origin lookup.
