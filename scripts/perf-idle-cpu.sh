# Idle-CPU probe (just perf-idle-cpu ...) against a LIVE rk daemon.
#
# Thin wrapper: the probe itself is scripts/perf-idle-cpu.mjs, which owns every
# flag (`--help` is authoritative there). This script only (1) refuses to start
# without Playwright — a fresh worktree has no app/frontend/node_modules until
# `just setup` runs — (2) supplies the default base URL when the caller passed
# no --url, and (3) supplies a display for --headed. The default URL comes from
# `rk url`, which reports the address the daemon WOULD bind (a heuristic, no
# liveness probe): a 0.0.0.0 host is rewritten to 127.0.0.1 because the bind
# address is not a connectable client target. rk absent or failing falls back
# silently to the daemon's config default — the toolkit's fail-silent rk rule.
# "No daemon there" surfaces as the probe's own load failure (exit 1), not here.
#
# --headed needs an X display. An exported DISPLAY is used as-is; with none, the
# probe runs under xvfb-run (the WebGL row for a box whose headless Chromium has
# none). `env -u DISPLAY` forces the Xvfb path.
#
# No NODE_PATH: ESM `import` ignores it. The probe resolves Playwright from
# app/frontend via createRequire, so it runs from any cwd.
