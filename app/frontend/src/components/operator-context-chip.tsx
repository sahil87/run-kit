/**
 * The chat-lane context chip — renders the attached chat subject beside
 * whichever compose surface is active: the quake terminal's docked compose
 * strip and the operator route's compose strip both mount one, reading the
 * ONE chat-subject store in lib/quake-terminal.ts so the two stay in
 * lockstep. Implicit context the
 * user cannot see erodes trust in what the operator was told, so the chip is
 * always visible while a send would attach the envelope, and its ✕ detaches it
 * (sends then ride the direct lane until the quake terminal re-engages or the subject
 * changes — the store owns both resets).
 *
 * `server` is the caller's resolved quake terminal server: a subject stamped for a
 * different server renders nothing (window ids are server-scoped, and
 * sendOperatorMessage applies the same guard at send time).
 *
 * With `onNavigate` provided (the operator route's compose-strip mount), the
 * label itself is a control that returns to the subject window — the chip
 * names exactly where the user came from, so it doubles as the way back. The
 * ✕ stays dismiss-only either way; the docked compose strip's mount passes
 * nothing and keeps an inert label.
