// rk agent setup — install the generic agent-state hooks that write the
// @rk_agent_state pane user option (see docs/specs/agent-state.md). It registers
// hook commands in a user-global agent config so any session of that agent, in
// any directory, under any workflow, reports lifecycle state. v1 targets Claude
// Code (~/.claude/settings.json); the per-agent registry makes codex/copilot/
// gemini/opencode additive follow-ups.
//
// The install is a JSON merge that preserves existing (non-rk) hooks and all
// other config, is idempotent (re-run replaces rk-owned entries in place, never
// duplicates), shows a diff and asks for confirmation before writing (it mutates
// user-global config), and supports --uninstall to remove exactly the rk-owned
// entries. All file writes go through Go; the hook command is a fixed literal per
// state with nothing user-provided interpolated (Constitution §I).
//
// rk agent setup manages two artifact families: the per-agent hooks merge above,
// and the user-global tmux guard shim (shim file + PATH block — see
// applyTmuxShim below and tmux_guard.go for the guard itself). It used to write
// a third managed artifact — a user-global "rk-display" SKILL.md that put
// run-kit's visual-display capability into an agent's context — but that context-injection
// responsibility has moved to the `rk skill` bundle (served by the skill
// subcommand, aggregated by the coming `shll agent-setup`). All rk agent setup does
// with the legacy skill now is a one-release CLEANUP courtesy: on BOTH the
// install and uninstall passes it offers to remove a stale, marker-owned
// rk-display skill left by an older run-kit (see removeLegacySkill). An absent
// file is silent in both modes — a fresh machine sees zero rk-display output.
// The cleanup path (and agentConfig.skillsDir, which locates the legacy skill)
// is scheduled for removal one release after this change.

// rkHookMarker is the LEGACY substring that identifies an rk-owned hook command:
// the pre-indirection self-contained one-liner inlined `tmux set-option … @rk_agent_state`,
// so the option name appearing in a command string was the "this entry is ours"
// signal. It IS the option name — one source of truth per binary (A-021), the
// canonical convention string lives in internal/tmux, not re-declared here.
//
// The NEW-generation command (agentStateHookCommand below) delegates to
// `rk agent hook` and no longer contains the option name, so it is instead
// identified by rkHookMarkerAgentHook (second generation) and
// rkHookMarkerAgentHookFamily (third generation). isRkEntry matches ALL THREE
// markers so a re-run of `rk agent setup` on the new binary strips
// older-generation entries and replaces them in place, and `--uninstall`
// removes every generation.
const rkHookMarker = tmux.AgentStateOption

// rkHookMarkerAgentHook identifies the second-generation delegating hook
// command by its ` agent-hook ` invocation substring. The surrounding spaces
// keep it from matching an unrelated token that merely contains "agent-hook".

// second-generation marker).

// `brew upgrade rk` with no settings churn and no agent session restarts. The

// walk and the `tmux set-option`) was frozen twice — once in
// ~/.claude/settings.json at install time, once in the harness's session-start
