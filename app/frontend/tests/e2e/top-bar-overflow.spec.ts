// Regression proof for the top-bar overflow chevron menu and for the fix
// that the measured right cell must FILL its `1fr` grid track (not be

// and `visibleCount` deadlocked at 0 — NOTHING rendered in-bar at any width;

//
// Covers the width sweep (1280 → 1024 → 800 → 700 → 640 → 500 → 375): (a) no
// top-bar bounding-box overlap; (b) L1 drops before L2 before L3; (c) the
// chevron menu contains the dropped + menuOnly rows + the version row,
// grouped under Tiles / View / Tab / App section labels (Tiles is desktop
// widths only — at mobile the surface-toggles entry forks to the pinned
// switch group with no menu rows); (d) the version row copies to the
// clipboard; (e) the exempt chevron is always visible (no connection dot in
// the bar — it lives in the desktop status bar / mobile drawer footer);
// (f) menu actions work from the menu; (g) the demoted controls
// (fixed-width, Aa, close-pane, the merged split control in terminal mode,
// plus the Help / Keyboard chrome rows — all `menuOnly`) render in-bar
// NOWHERE at any width while their rows are ALWAYS in the menu; (h) the
// Settings gear is a real fit candidate — the LAST one (Refresh drops before
// it) — rendering in-bar between Refresh and the chevron at desktop widths.
// The terminal fit tiers: L1 = the surface-toggle group (the L1 HEAD,
// leftmost, first to drop as one unit ON DESKTOP) + the ▦ Layout chip
// (overflowed, it renders one `Layout: …` radio row per arity-valid shape);
// L2 = empty; L3 = Refresh + Settings gear — the in-bar end state is
// [toggles] · ▦Layout · Refresh · Gear · chevron, with the chevron the SOLE
// element of the trailing exempt block.
//
// Shared setup: `beforeEach` route-stubs the derived dead port's
// `/proxy/<port>/**` with a static 200 page (stubProxyPorts from
// _web-tile.ts, port from reserveDeadPort — the dead-port error state hides
// the iframe when nothing listens on the stamped URL, and these tests assert
// tile chrome, never frame content). Real isolated tmux server: `beforeAll`
// creates a dedicated session with an extra named window (`overflow-win-<ts>`)
// so the terminal route renders the right cluster; the second describe adds a
// SECOND, web-capable long-named window (`overflow-view-long-worktree-<ts>`
// with a stamped web tab ⇒ `[tty|web]`; the repo-cwd pane also
// derives a `gitRoot` ⇒ `code`, so its toggle group shows Terminal/Web/Code)
// so the palette's `View: Web` action actually renders (the palette gates on
// a multi-view window). `resolveWindow`/`gotoWindow` (from `_ready.ts`)
// resolve the window id and navigate to `/${server}/${id}`. In-bar control
// visibility is measured via accessible-name ROLE queries scoped to the
// banner landmark, which exclude the always-present off-screen `inert` +
// `aria-hidden` measurement-probe copy — a match means the control is in-bar
// (the surface-toggle group is detected via its `Terminal tile` button —
// `getByTestId("surface-toggles")` is AMBIGUOUS, the probe carries a second
// copy when the group is in-bar; banner-scoping avoids the tty tile header's
// own `Close pane` button). The ViewSwitcher is RETIRED, so its absence is
// checked two ways: no accessible `role="group"` named `Window view` AND no
// `view-toggle` testid anywhere in the DOM (the probe carries no pill copy
// either — fit candidates only). `intersects()` is the standard rect-overlap
// helper (shared shape with top-bar-overlap.spec.ts).

// radio rows in the menu) drops next — the merged split control left the
// terminal bar in 260813-w1lf (pane verbs moved to the tty tile header's pane
// segment; the `split` entry is `menuOnly` in terminal mode now, its rows
// ALWAYS in the chevron menu — see MENU_ONLY below). On MOBILE (<640px) the
