/**
 * The ONE harness-port read. Every Playwright site that needs the rig's port
 * resolves it through here so the fail-closed fallback lives in exactly one
 * place.
 *
 * Read lazily at call time, never captured at module load: under the
 * multi-rig lane playwright.config.ts rewrites the harness env vars via
 * applyWorkerRig() before spec modules load (see _rig.ts for the ordering
 * contract), and a module-level capture in the config itself would freeze the
 * pre-rewrite value.
 *
 * E2E_PORT is set only by the harness (scripts/test-e2e.sh, scripts/pw.sh).
 * When unset, the fallback is the policy's PORTPOLICY_SENTINEL parsed from
 * ports.env — a bare `playwright test` connects there and finds nothing. The
 * ambient RK_PORT is never consulted: direnv exports it into every dev shell,
 * so reading it would point a bare run at a live dev server.
 *
 * Module-system constraint: the frontend package is "type": "module" (files
 * load as true ESM, where `__filename` is undefined) while the desktop
 * package loads this same file as CJS (where `import.meta` is a parse error,
 * so it can never appear here). A stack frame is the only self-location
 * anchor that survives both: the innermost frame of an Error created here
 * always names this file — a file:// URL under ESM, a plain path under CJS.
