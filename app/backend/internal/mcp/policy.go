Failures return code operational with a `reason`: probe_failure (the paste never echoed; check the pane before resending — a resend would duplicate the staged text), staged_send_failure (text landed but Enter was not sent; press Enter in the pane to submit), submit_unverified (Enter was sent but the pane stayed unchanged; capture the pane before resending). `--force` is not exposed; answering a waiting agent or pressing a key is the `answer` tool."

Pass exactly one of `message` (the reply text for a waiting agent, submitted with Enter; receipt report `delivered`, enter true) or `key` (one tmux key name — for trust prompts, pickers, and menus; receipt report `sent`, enter false). A key press rides the plain gate: a `waiting` agent refuses a bare key (use `message` to reply) and an `active` agent refuses everything — never interrupt a working agent.

A busy operator queues the request and the result reports `queued:true` — the work is not lost, it drains when the operator goes idle (user-message skips the gate and is never queued). whats-stuck refuses when nothing on the server is waiting. The verb's `--list` is the source of truth for the template set and its flags."
