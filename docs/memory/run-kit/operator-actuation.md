# Operator Actuation

**Domain**: run-kit

## Overview

The operator actuation seam lets run-kit hand the server's operator window (the
`@rk_win_role=operator` window — [tmux-sessions](/run-kit/tmux-sessions.md) § Operator
Session, [ui/sidebar](/run-kit/ui/sidebar.md) § Operator Pinned Row) a templated
work item over two routes: the window-scoped
`POST /api/windows/{windowId}/operator-request` (a work item ABOUT a subject
window) and the server-scoped `POST /api/operator-request?server=` (no subject
window). The loop is **delivery + derive, nothing else**:
the backend composes a prompt from facts it derives itself (Constitution X),
delivers it through the existing chat-send injection machinery
([chat](/run-kit/chat.md) § Send Path), and the operator acts through its own
shell (e.g. `tmux rename-window`, `rk riff`); the outcome surfaces on the normal derive
tick. There is NO persisted mailbox, NO response channel or reply parsing —
the operator is not an RPC service. A valid request against a busy operator
is not lost: the two HTTP handlers convert the delivery core's busy-class
rejection into an enqueue on an in-memory per-server queue
(`operatorQueueTracker`, `api/operator_queue.go`) and answer
`202 {"queued": true}`; a level-triggered drain on the SSE per-server tick
delivers one queued entry at a time once the operator reads idle. Queue state
is process memory only (Constitution II) — a daemon restart forgets queued
intents, degrading to plain busy rejection. This is a route-level contract:
the shared
injection engine may perform its own evidence-gated recovery before returning.
The seam has FOUR callers over ONE shared prompt-level delivery core
(`deliverOperatorPrompt` — the busy gate, operator pane resolution, injection
under the shared deadline): the two user-initiated HTTP handlers (window- and
server-scoped), the system-initiated **auto-name tracker**
(`api/auto_name.go`), which rides the SSE per-server tick beside the
waiting-push tracker and fires the `fix-tab-name` request when a subject window
transitions busy→idle — run-kit owns the derivable trigger, the operator owns
the rename judgment — and the **queue-tracker drain**, which enters the same
core through its deliver closure after fetching sessions fresh inside the
detached delivery goroutine, revalidating the queued request, and re-rendering
from current facts. The window-scoped subject-fact derivation layers above the
core as `deliverOperatorRequest` (shared by its handler and the tracker).
Everything lives in `app/backend/api/operator.go` (handlers + registry +
delivery cores), `app/backend/api/auto_name.go` (auto-name tracker), and
`app/backend/api/operator_queue.go` (queue tracker), the routes
registered in `api/router.go` beside the chat routes. Nothing in any existing
UI request path routes through the operator — operator features degrade to
**absent** when no operator runs, never to blocking (the inside/outside razor).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Endpoint contract + closed template registry
The backend SHALL expose two operator-request routes (mutation ⇒ POST,
Constitution IX), both registered in `api/router.go` beside the chat routes:
the window-scoped `POST /api/windows/{windowId}/operator-request?server={server}`
(`handleOperatorRequest`), where `{windowId}` is the **subject** window — the
window the request is about — and the server-scoped
`POST /api/operator-request?server={server}` (`handleServerOperatorRequest`),
which takes NO subject window. The shared JSON body is
`{"template": "<id>", "text": "<optional client string>", "session": "<optional
session name>"}`. The template id is
checked against the closed in-code registry `operatorTemplates`
(`map[string]operatorTemplate` — each entry declaring a `requiresChatRef` fact
requirement, an `acceptsText` client-text admission, a `serverScoped` scope
discriminator, a `requiresWaiting` zero-waiting precondition, an
`acceptsSession` session-scope admission, and a PURE render
func for its scope — `render
func(operatorFacts) string` window-scoped, `renderServer
func(serverOperatorFacts) string` server-scoped — plain string composition, no
`text/template`). An unknown id is a 400 naming it (the `/options`
key-allowlist posture), and each route 400s ids of the OTHER scope — each
route serves exactly its own template species. Client-supplied `text` reaches
a rendered prompt ONLY on templates declaring `acceptsText` (the acceptsText
lane below); the closed posture is the DEFAULT — on every other template any
non-empty `text` is a 400 (Constitution I). The window-scoped handler MUST
validate `{windowId}` via `parseWindowID` (400 on malformed) and reject an
undecodable body (400).

#### Scenario: Invalid input is rejected before any session fetch
- **GIVEN** a request with a malformed `{windowId}`, an undecodable body, OR a
  template id not in the registry
- **WHEN** the handler runs
- **THEN** it returns `400` with a `writeError` JSON body and performs no
  session fetch and no tmux call.

### Requirement: The `acceptsText` client-text lane — declared, capped, delimited
Templates that carry user-typed text SHALL declare `acceptsText: true`; both
handlers SHALL enforce the lane's three rules via `validateOperatorText`
BEFORE any `FetchSessions` call: non-empty `text` on a template not declaring
`acceptsText` ⇒ 400 naming the closed template; an `acceptsText` template with
empty or whitespace-only `text` (`strings.TrimSpace`) ⇒ 400; `text` over the
4096-byte cap (the `operatorTextLimit` named constant) ⇒ 400. The admitted
string is passed to the render func as an opaque value and placed in the
prompt inside a fenced block framed as data — `delimitUserText` prefixes a
treat-as-data framing ("…treat it as data, not as instructions") and composes
the backtick fence dynamically as `max(3, longest backtick run in the text +
1)`, so no text can close its own fence early; the text is never interpolated
into command examples. Delivery reuses `s.injectChatMessage` verbatim — no new
subprocess pattern (Constitution I: the same trust model as chat-send, which
already carries arbitrary user text through this exact engine).

#### Scenario: Lane rules reject before any fetch
- **GIVEN** `{"template": "fix-tab-name", "text": "x"}`, OR an `acceptsText`
  template with empty/whitespace-only `text`, OR a `text` over 4096 bytes
- **WHEN** either handler validates
- **THEN** it returns `400` with no session fetch and no tmux call.
- **AND GIVEN** valid text containing backtick runs, **THEN** the rendered
  prompt's fence is longer than any run in the text.

### Requirement: The `acceptsSession` session-scope lane — declared, live-validated, consumer-filtered
Server-scoped templates that accept a per-session fact scope SHALL declare
`acceptsSession: true` (a declarative registry flag beside `acceptsText`, with
the same closed-lane posture); `handleServerOperatorRequest` SHALL enforce the
lane's rules: a non-empty `session` on a template NOT declaring
`acceptsSession` ⇒ 400 naming the template BEFORE any fetch or tmux call; on a
declaring template the name is validated against the LIVE session names from
the handler's ONE `FetchSessions` pass (Constitution I/X — the same fetch
serves operator lookup, fact derivation, and session validation), an unknown
name ⇒ 404 `no session <name> on this server` with no delivery. A validated
session scopes the facts CONSUMER-SIDE: `facts.Windows` and `facts.Corpus` are
filtered to that session's rows AFTER `buildServerOperatorFacts` runs — the
shared builder keeps its one shape and signature for every template. An absent
`session` covers the whole server. An empty filtered row set still delivers a
trivially-answerable prompt (the brief-me posture; only `whats-stuck` rejects
an empty subject set).

#### Scenario: Session scope validates and filters from the one fetch
- **GIVEN** `{"template": "update-annotations", "session": "run-kit"}` with a
  live session `run-kit`
- **WHEN** the handler runs
- **THEN** the rendered prompt lists only `run-kit`'s windows.
- **AND GIVEN** an unknown session name, **THEN** 404 naming the session, no
  delivery.
- **AND GIVEN** `{"template": "brief-me", "session": "run-kit"}` (`brief-me`
  declares no `acceptsSession`), **THEN** 400 naming `brief-me`, before any
  fetch.

### Requirement: Server-scoped route over the shared delivery seam
`handleServerOperatorRequest` SHALL run body validation (registry + scope +
the acceptsText rules) first, then ONE `s.sessions.FetchSessions` pass: the
operator window resolves via the shared `findOperatorWindow` helper
(`Role == "operator"` over the already-fetched slice; absent ⇒ 404
`"no operator on this server"` — the UI hides the action in that state, so the
error is the race backstop), and `buildServerOperatorFacts` pre-derives the
server fact tables from the same fetch (Constitution X) — every non-operator
window into the routing table as a digest-grade row (session, `@N`, name,
worktree, rolled-up agent state + duration, fab change/stage when non-empty,
the PR rollup `PrState`/`PrChecks`/`PrReview` filled only when `PrURL` is
non-nil, the current label state (`Color`/`Marker`/`Flair`, `""` when unset —
only the `color-tabs` row writer renders them), and the per-row transcript
JSONL path via `chat.TranscriptPath` — one
resolution per window filling both the row and the corpus), every non-operator
chat-carrying window additionally into the transcript corpus, a ref that fails
to resolve degrading to a PATH-LESS table row and an OMITTED corpus row, never
an error. After fact derivation and BEFORE render/delivery, a template
declaring `requiresWaiting` with ZERO fact rows at `AgentState == waiting` is a
structured 409 `"nothing is waiting on this server"` with no delivery — the
seam's valid-request-wrong-state class, same as the busy gate. Delivery goes through
`deliverOperatorPrompt`, the seam BOTH handlers share so the two cannot drift:
the busy gate (`active`/`waiting` ⇒ 409 naming the state; `idle` or unknown
proceeds), `sessions.ResolveChatPane` over the operator's panes (404
`"operator window has no chat session"` when none), and in-process
`s.injectChatMessage` under ONE shared `chatSendTotalBudget` deadline, a probe
failure, a post-paste `StagedSendFailure` (`staged_send_failure`), and
`SubmitUnverified` surfacing as the three distinct structured 409s chat-send
returns. The route shares the seam's whole posture: NO queue, NO
route-level retry, NO response channel, NO SSE hub wake; success is
`200 {"ok":true}`. A `FetchSessions` error maps to
`500`.

#### Scenario: Server-scoped resolution from one fetch
- **GIVEN** a server with an idle operator and body
  `{"template": "spawn-task", "text": "fix the flaky test"}`
- **WHEN** `POST /api/operator-request?server=` runs
- **THEN** exactly one FetchSessions occurs, injection targets the operator's
  resolved pane, and the response is `200 {"ok":true}`.
- **AND GIVEN** a busy (`active`/`waiting`) operator, **THEN** 409 naming the
  state, no injection.
- **AND GIVEN** no operator on the server, **THEN** 404
  `"no operator on this server"`.
- **AND GIVEN** `{"template": "fix-tab-name"}` on the server-scoped route (or
  `spawn-task` on the window-scoped route), **THEN** 400.
- **AND GIVEN** a `requiresWaiting` template (`whats-stuck`) with no window at
  `waiting`, **THEN** 409 `"nothing is waiting on this server"` and no
  injection.

### Requirement: Single-FetchSessions resolution of subject + operator
The handler SHALL resolve everything server-side from ONE
`s.sessions.FetchSessions(ctx, server)` call: the subject window by `WindowID`
and the operator window as the window with `Role == "operator"` (the
server-scoped radio; the shared `findOperatorWindow` helper over the
already-fetched slice). A `FetchSessions` error maps to `500` (an infrastructure
fault, mirroring the chat endpoints); an absent subject maps to `404`; no
operator window on the server maps to `404` with `"no operator on this
server"` — the UI hides the action in that state (degrade to absent), so the
error is the race backstop. The handler MUST NOT call `resolveWindowChat`
(which would issue a second `FetchSessions`); pane resolution reuses
`sessions.ResolveChatPane` on the already-fetched windows. Subject and operator
are then handed ALREADY RESOLVED to the shared delivery core
(`deliverOperatorRequest`), which performs no fetch of its own — the auto-name
caller passes windows straight from the tick's sessions snapshot.

#### Scenario: No operator on the server
- **GIVEN** a server whose sessions contain no window with `Role == "operator"`
- **WHEN** the handler resolves
- **THEN** it returns `404` `"no operator on this server"` and performs no
  injection.

### Requirement: Server-side fact pre-derivation
The delivery core SHALL derive the template facts (`operatorFacts`) server-side —
all derivable (Constitution X): the subject's `windowId` (`@N`), current `Name`,
`WorktreePath`, `FabChange`/`FabStage` (rendered only when `FabChange` is
non-empty), and — for a template declaring `requiresChatRef` — the transcript
JSONL absolute path resolved from the subject's reconciled
`ChatProvider`/`ChatSessionRef` via `chat.TranscriptPath` (the exported
`TranscriptLocator` seam — [chat](/run-kit/chat.md) § Adapter interface +
provider registry). A subject with no reconciled chat session is a 404-class
error (`"no chat session for this window"`); an unresolvable transcript
(`ErrInvalidRef`/`ErrTranscriptNotFound`) maps through `writeChatReadError`,
the same 404-class vocabulary as the chat read endpoints; `ErrNoAdapter` is a
404 naming the provider.

#### Scenario: Subject without a resolvable transcript
- **GIVEN** a subject window whose reconciled chat ref is empty or whose
  transcript cannot be located
- **WHEN** facts are derived
- **THEN** the response is a 404-class `writeError` and no injection occurs.
- **AND GIVEN** a resolvable ref, **THEN** the rendered prompt contains the
  windowId, name, absolute JSONL path, and worktree path.

### Requirement: Busy gate on the operator's agent state — reject at the core, enqueue at the routes
The delivery core SHALL read the operator window's rolled-up `AgentState`
(already on the same `FetchSessions` result) BEFORE delivering. `active` or
`waiting` ⇒ reject with a structured message naming the state (`"operator is
busy (<state>) — request not delivered; try again when it is idle"`). `idle`
or empty/unknown ⇒ proceed — the novelty echo probe is the final fail-closed
pre-Enter guard, exactly as for chat-send. This is deliberately UNLIKE
chat-send's allow+probe busy policy ([chat](/run-kit/chat.md) § Design
Decisions → Allow + probe busy policy): a request is work handed over, not a
steer a human typed. The gate is the fail-closed floor inside
`deliverOperatorPrompt` for EVERY delivery through the core — the HTTP
handlers, the auto-name caller, and the queue drain alike (at drain it reads
the goroutine's FRESH fetch, so it doubles as a real re-busy check).
Failures the HTTP handler maps to a status+body surface
from the core as a typed `operatorReject{status,msg}` sentinel the handler maps
back byte-identically — with ONE branch at the routes: both handlers convert
the busy-class sentinel (409 + the `"operator is busy ("` message, matched by
`isBusyOperatorReject`) into an enqueue on the server's `operatorQueueTracker`
and respond `202 {"queued": true}`, so a busy 409 can never escape the HTTP
routes; a queue-full refusal maps to `409 "operator queue is full"`. Every
other validation outcome stays fail-fast at request time (400s, 404s, the
`requiresWaiting` zero-waiting 409) and enqueues nothing. Transcript-resolution
and injection errors return RAW so
the handler's `errors.Is`/`errors.As` mappings (`writeChatReadError`
vocabulary, `inject.ProbeFailure` → 409, `inject.StagedSendFailure` → 409
`staged_send_failure`, `inject.SubmitUnverified` → 409) apply.
The auto-name caller
logs whatever comes back at debug and drops it (busy-skip included — auto-name
stays outside the queue).

#### Scenario: Busy operator enqueues at the routes, never injects
- **GIVEN** an operator window whose rollup state is `active` (or `waiting`)
- **WHEN** a valid request arrives on either HTTP route
- **THEN** the response is `202 {"queued": true}`, no injection subprocess
  runs, and the request sits in the tracker's per-server queue.
- **AND GIVEN** state `idle` or empty, **THEN** delivery proceeds and success
  is `200 {"ok":true}`.
- **AND GIVEN** a full queue (8 pending entries), **THEN** the response is
  `409 "operator queue is full"` and nothing is enqueued.

### Requirement: Delivery through the shared injection engine, in-process
Every caller SHALL deliver the rendered prompt through the shared prompt-level
core `deliverOperatorPrompt` (so the paths cannot drift), which delivers
in-process via
`s.injectChatMessage(ctx, server, operatorPaneID, prompt, true)` — the same
`api`-package seam chat-send uses, NOT an HTTP self-call — where
`operatorPaneID` is `sessions.ResolveChatPane(operator.Panes)` over the
OPERATOR window's panes (active-pane-first rollup; injection targets the pane,
never the window, never the subject's pane). An operator window with no
reconciled chat pane ⇒ `404` (`"operator window has no chat session"` — an
operator that isn't a live agent can't receive requests). The engine semantics
are handler-boundary sanitize, per-(server,paneID)
whole-sequence lock, ONE shared deadline (`chatSendTotalBudget`, applied
INSIDE the core so both callers get identical injection bounding) threading all
subprocesses, novelty echo probe, post-Enter observation, and evidence-gated
recovery. `inject.ProbeFailure` returns the staged-text `409` with Enter withheld;
`inject.StagedSendFailure` (a post-paste, pre-Enter infrastructure failure)
returns the `staged_send_failure` `409` — the text is staged and a resend would
duplicate it; `inject.SubmitUnverified` returns the submit-unconfirmed `409`
after Enter and directs the caller to capture the pane before resending. Success is
`200 {"ok":true}`. The handler MUST NOT wake
the SSE hub: rk mutated no tmux state, and the operator's later actuation (e.g.
`rename-window`) surfaces via the normal derive tick.

#### Scenario: Delivery targets the operator's resolved pane
- **GIVEN** an idle operator whose resolved chat pane is `%7`
- **WHEN** delivery runs
- **THEN** every injection subprocess targets `%7`, the sequence is baseline →
  set-buffer → paste → probe → Enter → observation/recovery, and the response is
  `200 {"ok":true}` when the engine returns success.
- **AND GIVEN** the probe fails, **THEN** no Enter is sent and the response is
  the structured `409`.
- **AND GIVEN** a post-paste, pre-Enter infrastructure failure (e.g. the Enter
  `send-keys` is refused), **THEN** the response is the `staged_send_failure`
  `409`.
- **AND GIVEN** non-submission is detected and bounded recovery cannot establish
  a safe successful outcome, **THEN** the response is the distinct
  submit-unconfirmed `409`.

### Requirement: The `fix-tab-name` template
The registry's `fix-tab-name` entry SHALL declare `requiresChatRef: true` and
render a self-contained prompt (the operator needs no rk-specific knowledge)
that names the subject by `@N` (an id that survives moves and is
collision-proof vs name targets), hands the operator the transcript path to
read (the chat JSONL, never capture-pane — agent TUIs run alt-screen with zero
scrollback), gives the worktree and — only when `FabChange` is non-empty — the
fab change + stage context, names the exact actuation command
(`tmux rename-window -t {windowId} "<new-name>"`, 2-4 words, kebab-case
preferred), instructs the operator to DO NOTHING when the current name already
accurately describes the work (the no-op judgment belongs to the operator, not
to run-kit — the inside/outside razor), and explicitly bounds the operator's
action ("Do not reply to this message or take any other action").

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt carries the derived facts
- **GIVEN** the derived facts for window `@5` named `zsh` with a resolvable
  transcript
- **WHEN** the template renders
- **THEN** the prompt names `@5`, the current name, the absolute JSONL path,
  the worktree, the exact `tmux rename-window -t @5` command, the
  already-accurate⇒do-nothing clause, and the do-not-reply bound; with an empty
  `FabChange` no fab clause appears.

### Requirement: Auto-name on idle — the system-initiated caller
The backend SHALL run an in-memory `autoNameTracker` (`api/auto_name.go`) on
the SSE per-server tick — advanced synchronously right after the waiting-push
block, a structural sibling of `waitingPushTracker` (own mutex, clock seam,
injected `deliver` closure, post-loop `retain`) — that observes every window's
rolled-up `AgentState` and detects the per-window transition **busy → idle**
(busy = `active` or `waiting`; idle = exactly `idle`; empty/unknown is neither
— a window with no agent hooks never triggers, and a first-ever observation or
a `""`→`idle` tick is not a transition). A candidate SHALL be dropped unless
ALL hold, derived from the same tick's snapshot with NO second `FetchSessions`:
the server HAS an operator window (`Role == "operator"`), the subject is NOT
the operator window, and the subject carries a non-empty `ChatSessionRef`. Rate
limits: a 15-minute per-window cooldown (`autoNameCooldown`), a 60-second
per-server min-gap (`autoNameMinGap` — the operator's `AgentState` lags a
delivery by a hook round-trip, so back-to-back transitions must not
double-deliver), and at most ONE delivery per server per tick (excess
candidates dropped UNSTAMPED, so their next transition may fire). Both limits
stamp at DECISION time on every attempt — including one the delivery core later
skips on a busy operator — so a busy operator never converts deferred
transitions into a later burst; ineligible transitions are consumed unstamped.
Delivery runs in a DETACHED `context.Background()` goroutine through the shared
core (the tick never blocks on injection, mirroring `notifyWaiting`); errors —
the routine busy-skip included — are logged at debug and dropped. State is
process-memory only (a daemon restart forgets cooldowns, Constitution II) and
reaped on the post-loop retain seam, scoped to successfully-polled-or-dead
servers exactly like `waitingPushTracker.retain`. The feature is strictly
OPT-IN: the `auto_name` key in the settings store (`internal/settings`,
`~/.config/run-kit/config.yaml` — tolerant `ParseBool` read, default off, serialized
only when true), `live: true` in the registry (5r41). The construction-time
seed (`Server.autoNameEnabled` from `settings.Load()`) is only `initSSEHub`'s
initial apply: a successful `POST /api/settings` whose body contains
`auto_name` (set or null-unset) re-applies the post-merge value through the
hub's single apply seam (`sseHub.setAutoName` behind `autoNameMu` — see
[architecture](/run-kit/architecture.md) § SSE Hub), publishing nil on disable
and a freshly-built deliver-wired tracker on enable (prior in-memory
cooldowns drop — the process-memory semantics above), so a toggle takes live
effect without a daemon restart. The deliver closure is built once by
`Server.autoNameDeliver()`, so the startup seed and the POST re-apply share
identical wiring. A nil tracker is the feature-absent state both tick sites
(advance, retain) already check. There is deliberately NO `RK_AUTO_NAME` env
var — env is deployment bootstrap, not a settings channel. When enabled, the
trigger still requires an operator window
on the server — no operator ⇒ nothing fires, nothing logs at error level
(degrade to absent).

#### Scenario: Transition detection and eligibility
- **GIVEN** a window whose previous tick state was `active` (or `waiting`)
- **WHEN** the current tick derives its rollup as `idle`
- **THEN** the tracker emits a candidate for that window; `idle`→`idle`,
  `""`→`idle`, and first-observation ticks emit nothing.
- **AND GIVEN** a transition on a chatless window, on the operator window
  itself, or on an operator-less server, **THEN** no delivery is attempted and
  the transition is consumed unstamped.

#### Scenario: Rate limits bound a flapping window
- **GIVEN** a window that fired an auto-request 5 minutes ago
- **WHEN** it transitions busy→idle again
- **THEN** no delivery is attempted (cooldown).
- **AND GIVEN** two eligible windows transitioning in the same tick, **THEN**
  exactly one is emitted and the other is dropped unstamped.
- **AND GIVEN** an operator busy at delivery time, **THEN** the core skips (no
  injection, no queue, no retry) and the window's cooldown stays stamped.

### Requirement: Operator-request queue — drain on idle (the user-initiated busy path)
The backend SHALL run an in-memory per-server `operatorQueueTracker`
(`api/operator_queue.go`), a structural sibling of `autoNameTracker` (own
mutex, `now func() time.Time` clock seam, injected `deliver` closure seam —
nil in test hubs, tracking still advancing, fan-out skipped), advanced
synchronously on the SSE per-server tick right after the auto-name block and
reaped on the post-loop retain seam (scoped to successfully-polled-or-dead
servers exactly like its siblings, keyed off the polled-server set). Queueing
is always-on — NO settings key (it preserves an explicit user action, unlike
the opt-in system-initiated auto-name trigger) — so the tracker is constructed
unconditionally at hub construction and its deliver closure wired at
`initSSEHub` (the `autoNameDeliver` builder shape, a `Server` method closing
over the drain revalidate + re-render + `deliverOperatorPrompt` sequence);
handlers reach it through the hub (the `getAutoName` accessor pattern). State
is process-memory only: a daemon restart forgets queued intents, degrading to
plain busy rejection (Constitution II).

Entries queue the REQUEST, never the rendered prompt: `{template, windowID,
text, session, enqueuedAt}`. Enqueue dedups on the key `(template,
windowID/session, hash(text))` — a repeated tap coalesces idempotently onto the
existing entry (the caller sees the same queued outcome) and KEEPS the original
`enqueuedAt` (no TTL extension by re-tapping). Depth is capped at 8 per server
(`operatorQueueCap`); overflow refuses with a queue-full signal the handler
maps to `409 "operator queue is full"`. Order is FIFO (oldest first), and the
one entry reserved for detached delivery still counts toward the cap and the
dedup set until its delivery settles (a busy race can never briefly admit a
ninth pending intent).

On each tick the tracker evaluates the LEVEL condition — operator window
present AND its rolled-up `AgentState` reads exactly `idle` AND the queue is
non-empty AND the per-server drain min-gap (`operatorQueueMinGap`, 60s — the
`autoNameMinGap` value and rationale: the operator's rolled-up state lags an
injection by a hook round-trip) has elapsed — and when it holds, pops exactly
ONE entry (FIFO), stamps the min-gap at decision time on the tracker's OWN
per-server stamp (independent of `autoNameTracker.lastSent`), and delivers in a
detached `context.Background()` goroutine (the tick never blocks on injection).
Entries older than 30 minutes (`operatorQueueTTL`, measured from `enqueuedAt`)
are dropped quietly at tick time (debug log only), independent of operator
state — an operator parked in `waiting` for hours must not deliver stale
intents.

The detached delivery goroutine performs its OWN fresh `FetchSessions` and
re-derives everything from that result — it retains NO reference to the tick's
shared sessions slice (later cache-hit ticks mutate it, an unsynchronized
read/write race). From the fresh result it re-runs the same gates the live
path runs (subject window alive and not the operator; chat ref resolvable via
`chat.TranscriptPath` for `requiresChatRef` templates; `requiresWaiting` still
satisfied; `session` scope still names a live session; operator window present
with a resolvable chat pane), re-renders via the entry's registry render func
over freshly built facts (the same consumer-side session filtering as the
handler), and delivers through `deliverOperatorPrompt` — whose busy gate,
reading FRESH state, is a real re-busy check. Failure policy: a busy-class
`operatorReject` (the operator went busy between the tick's idle observation
and the injection — nothing was typed) or a `FetchSessions` error REQUEUES the
entry at the head of its queue for a later idle observation; every other
failure (gate failures, `inject.ProbeFailure`/`SubmitUnverified`, any other
injection error) DROPS the entry quietly — a debug log line, never a retry
(nobody is watching at drain; a retry could double-paste into the composer).

#### Scenario: Drain on idle, one entry per observation
- **GIVEN** two queued entries and an operator observed `idle` with the min-gap
  elapsed
- **WHEN** the tick advances the tracker
- **THEN** exactly one entry is popped and handed to the fresh-fetch deliver
  closure; the second entry waits for a later idle observation.
- **AND GIVEN** the operator turned `active` before the goroutine's fresh
  fetch, **THEN** the busy gate rejects on fresh state and the entry is back at
  the head of the queue, draining on a later idle observation.
- **AND GIVEN** a popped entry whose subject window no longer exists, **THEN**
  it is dropped with a debug log and no injection runs.
- **AND GIVEN** an entry enqueued 31 minutes ago behind a `waiting` operator,
  **THEN** the next tick drops it (debug log only) without delivering.

#### Scenario: Coalesce and cap
- **GIVEN** a queued `{fix-tab-name, @5}` entry
- **WHEN** the same request is enqueued again
- **THEN** the queue still holds one entry with the original `enqueuedAt`.
- **AND GIVEN** a queue already holding 8 entries, **WHEN** a distinct request
  arrives, **THEN** enqueue is refused queue-full.

### Requirement: The `spawn-task` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `spawn-task` entry (`serverScoped: true`, `acceptsText: true`)
SHALL render the routing fact table — for every non-operator window across the
server's sessions: session name, `@N` window id, window name, worktree path,
agent state, and fab change/stage when non-empty — then the user's task text
in the delimited data block, then the instruction to pick an appropriate
worktree/preset and spawn via the `rk riff` CLI (naming the discovery commands
`rk riff --list-presets`, the `rk riff [--preset <p>] "<task>"` shape, and
`rk riff --help` for the full flags), and the explicit bounds: spawn EXACTLY
ONE agent, do not modify any existing window, and on repo/project ambiguity
ask nothing — pick the current server's dominant project and note the choice
in the spawned window's name. The operator spawns through its own shell —
run-kit adds no backend spawn path.

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt carries the routing table and bounds
- **GIVEN** derived facts for a server with two work windows and an operator
- **WHEN** the template renders with text "add retry to the flaky poll"
- **THEN** the prompt contains both windows' rows (and not the operator's own
  row), the delimited task text, the `rk riff` instructions, and the
  spawn-exactly-one bound.

### Requirement: The `find-discussion` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `find-discussion` entry (`serverScoped: true`,
`acceptsText: true`) SHALL render the transcript corpus — for every
non-operator window with a reconciled chat session: session name, `@N`, window
name, and the absolute transcript JSONL path via `chat.TranscriptPath`
(unresolvable refs omitted, per the broken-ref rule) — then the user's query
in the delimited data block, then the instruction to search the corpus
semantically (read tails, grep for related terms, follow context) and answer
IN ITS OWN WINDOW, naming the matching window(s) by name and `@N` with a
one-line why-it-matches each, and the read-only bound (take no action on any
other window). The answer reaches the user in the operator tab via the normal
derive tick.

#### Scenario: Only resolvable transcripts reach the prompt
- **GIVEN** a server with two chat-carrying windows, one chatless window, and
  one window whose ref fails to resolve
- **WHEN** the template renders with a query
- **THEN** the prompt lists exactly the two resolvable transcript paths with
  their window identities, the delimited query, the answer-in-your-own-window
  instruction, and the read-only bound.

### Requirement: The `brief-me` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `brief-me` entry (`serverScoped: true`, no `acceptsText` —
client text hits the closed-lane 400) SHALL render a standup-digest prompt
listing every routing-table row on a waiting-first SORTED COPY of
`facts.Windows` (waiting, then active, then idle/unknown — `digestStateRank`;
stable within a group by session then `@N`; the shared builder's natural order
is unchanged) — identity, state + duration, fab/PR clauses when present, and
the transcript path (or a `transcript unavailable` note when empty). The prompt
instructs the operator: read each transcript tail (the JSONL path, ~30 lines —
never capture-pane; agent TUIs run alt-screen with zero scrollback), work from
listed facts alone when the transcript is unavailable, and produce a
one-line-per-tab digest — current state, what it is waiting on (when waiting),
one suggested next action — ordered waiting-on-me first, written AS THE
OPERATOR'S OWN REPLY IN ITS OWN WINDOW (the user reads it by switching to the
operator tab; there is no response channel). Bounds: read-only — take no
action on any window; do not rename, kill, or send keys anywhere. An empty row
table still delivers a trivially-answerable "nothing to report" prompt (only
`whats-stuck` rejects an empty subject set).

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt is waiting-first with the degradation note
- **GIVEN** derived facts with waiting, active, and broken-ref windows
- **WHEN** `brief-me` renders
- **THEN** the prompt lists every row with the waiting rows first, notes the
  broken-ref row's missing transcript, and carries the transcript-tail
  instruction, the waiting-on-me-first ordering, the own-window instruction,
  and the read-only bounds.

### Requirement: The `whats-stuck` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `whats-stuck` entry (`serverScoped: true`,
`requiresWaiting: true`, no `acceptsText`) SHALL render a triage prompt over
ONLY the waiting rows (filtered in the render func; the handler's
`requiresWaiting` gate has already rejected a zero-waiting server). For each
waiting tab the prompt instructs the operator to read the transcript tail to
find the pending question. ROUTINE prompts (trust/permission dialogs, yes/no
confirmations with an obvious safe answer) may be answered directly via the
named verb `rk mux send @N "<answer>" --answer` (the `--answer` flag is
required: a waiting pane refuses a plain send). Everything else is ESCALATED,
never answered, via `rk notify --title "<window-name>: stuck" "<the pending
question>"`. The prompt carries the hard never-answer list — credential or
login prompts, destructive confirmations (delete/overwrite/reset), anything
ambiguous — escalate those instead. Bounds: touch only the waiting windows
listed; do not rename or kill any window.

#### Scenario: Only waiting rows, both verbs, the never-answer list
- **GIVEN** two waiting windows and one active window
- **WHEN** `whats-stuck` renders
- **THEN** the prompt lists exactly the two waiting rows, names `rk mux send
  @N "<answer>" --answer` and `rk notify --title` verbatim, and carries the
  never-answer list.

### Requirement: The `color-tabs` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `color-tabs` entry (`serverScoped: true`, no `acceptsText`, no
`requiresWaiting`) SHALL render a semantic tab-coloring prompt over the routing
table — every non-operator window row via its own row writer
(`writeColorTabsRow`): identity (session, `@N`, name), worktree, agent state,
fab change/stage when non-empty, the row's current label state as
`labels: color=<v|-> marker=<v|-> flair=<v|->` (`-` for an unset channel — the
operator needs to see what is already set for its do-nothing judgment), and the
transcript path or a `transcript unavailable` note. The prompt then instructs,
in order: (1) READ each tab — the transcript JSONL tail (~30 lines; never
capture-pane for an agent tab — alt-screen zero scrollback), with
`rk mux capture @N` as the fallback for a tab with no transcript (plain shell
windows have real scrollback); (2) CATEGORIZE — a suggested default scheme
(feature → `blue`, bugfix → `red`, infra/tooling → `slate`, docs → `teal`,
experiments → `purple`); the operator MAY substitute a scheme that better fits
the server's work mix but MUST apply ONE coherent scheme across all tabs —
same-category tabs share a hue; (3) ACTUATE through its own shell —
`tmux set-option -t @N '@rk_win_color' '<value>'` with the closed vocabularies
enumerated verbatim (the 10 color family names, optional `-dark`/`-light`
shade suffix; optional sparing `@rk_win_marker` mode × stage / `@rk_win_flair`
accents, color the primary channel) and the unset form
`tmux set-option -t @N -u '@rk_win_color'`. The marker literal contains only
the twelve `manual`/`auto`/`blocked` mode × stage tokens accepted for writes.
The marker and flair token runs are **literals in the prompt template**, kept
honest by a set-equality invariant in `api/operator_test.go`
(`promptVocab("@rk_win_marker") == closedSetTokens(validate.MarkerValues)`, and
the same for flair): the prompt cannot enumerate a vocabulary the server would
reject, so any change to `validate.markerTokens` / `flairTokens` fails
`go test ./api` until the literal follows;
(4) JUDGMENT — do nothing to a tab whose current labels already fit the scheme;
existing manual colors may be reassigned (reversible via the color + flair picker);
(5) the repaint note — the sidebar repaints within ~15 seconds of the last
set-option (the safety poll), no further action needed; (6) BOUNDS — set only
the three named options on the listed windows; do not rename, kill, or send
keys to any window; do not reply. An empty routing table still delivers a
trivially-answerable nothing-to-color prompt (the brief-me posture).

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt carries label rows, vocabularies, and bounds
- **GIVEN** facts with two work windows (one labeled `color=blue`, one
  unlabeled with no transcript)
- **WHEN** `color-tabs` renders
- **THEN** the prompt contains both rows with their `labels:` clauses, the
  `rk mux capture` fallback, all three closed vocabularies verbatim, the unset
  form, the coherent-scheme and do-nothing clauses, the repaint note, and the
  bounds; the operator's own row never appears.
- **AND GIVEN** zero non-operator windows, **THEN** the prompt still renders
  and delivery proceeds.

### Requirement: The `update-annotations` template (server-scoped)
The registry's `update-annotations` entry (`serverScoped: true`,
`acceptsSession: true`, no `acceptsText`) SHALL render a note-writing prompt
over the routing table — one `writeDigestRow` row per non-operator window
(identity session/`@N`/name, worktree, agent state + duration, fab change/stage
when non-empty, and the per-row transcript JSONL path or the `rk mux capture
@N` fallback note for a tab with no transcript — plain shell windows have real
scrollback, agent TUIs do not). For each tab the prompt instructs the operator
to: READ the transcript tail (~30 JSONL lines; NEVER capture-pane an agent
tab), with `rk mux capture @N` as the fallback for a transcript-less tab; then
WRITE or refresh a short one-line `@rk_win_note` saying WHY the tab is in its
current state via the exact epoch-prefixed actuation
`tmux set-option -wt @N @rk_win_note "$(date +%s):<one-line note>"`, bounded at
~100 characters — the WRITE form only (skip leaves an existing note in place;
no unset form is offered), with the explicit skip-the-write clause when there
is nothing meaningful to say; then the repaint note (~15s safety poll) and the
bounds (set only `@rk_win_note`, only on the listed windows; do not rename, kill,
or send keys; do not reply). An empty row table still delivers a
trivially-answerable prompt (the brief-me posture). The notes surface via the
normal derive tick — user-option mutations emit no control-mode event, so the
writes ride the ~12s safety poll
([tmux-sessions](/run-kit/tmux-sessions.md) § Server-Scoped User Options). The
optional `session` body field scopes the fact table to one session (the
acceptsSession lane above).

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt carries the rows, actuation, and bounds
- **GIVEN** a server with two agent windows and an idle operator
- **WHEN** `update-annotations` renders
- **THEN** the prompt lists both rows (the operator's own row never appears),
  the transcript-tail read instruction with the `rk mux capture` fallback, the
  exact epoch-prefixed `tmux set-option -wt @N @rk_win_note` command with the
  ~100-char bound, the skip-when-nothing-meaningful clause, the repaint note,
  and the write-only bounds.
- **AND GIVEN** zero non-operator windows, **THEN** the prompt still renders
  and delivery proceeds.
- **AND GIVEN** `{"template": "update-annotations"}` on the window-scoped
  route, **THEN** it 400s naming the server-scoped id.

### Requirement: The `annotate-tab` template (window-scoped)
The registry's `annotate-tab` entry (`requiresChatRef: true`, window-scoped —
no `serverScoped`, no `acceptsText`) SHALL ride the window route unchanged and
render from `operatorFacts` (the `renderFixTabName` shape): read the subject
tab's transcript tail (~30 JSONL lines), then write a one-line `@rk_win_note`
status note saying WHY the tab is in its current state via the exact
epoch-prefixed actuation
`tmux set-option -wt {windowId} @rk_win_note "$(date +%s):<one-line note>"`,
bounded at ~100 characters (the bound lives in the prompt because the
operator writes raw `set-option` — no API validation path applies; the
`/options` endpoint's own cap is 120), with an explicit skip-the-write
instruction when there is nothing meaningful to say, and the standard
no-reply/no-other-action bound. The note surfaces via the normal derive tick
— user-option mutations emit no control-mode event, so the write rides the
~12s safety poll ([tmux-sessions](/run-kit/tmux-sessions.md) § Server-Scoped
User Options).

#### Scenario: Rendered prompt names the epoch-prefixed set-option actuation
- **GIVEN** facts for window `@7` with a resolvable transcript
- **WHEN** `annotate-tab` renders
- **THEN** the prompt names `@7`, the transcript path, the exact
  `tmux set-option -wt @7 @rk_win_note "$(date +%s):<one-line note>"` command
  with the ~100-char bound and the skip-if-nothing-meaningful clause, and the
  no-reply bound.
- **AND GIVEN** `{"template": "annotate-tab"}` on the server-scoped route,
  **THEN** it 400s naming the template as window-scoped.

### Requirement: Frontend availability — degrade to ABSENT, never disabled
The window-scoped operator affordances — the flyout's `FixTabNameActionRow`
([ui/status-signals](/run-kit/ui/status-signals.md) § Row-hover register flyout
card) and the palette's `Tab: Fix name (ask operator)` / `Operator: Annotate
tab` entries
([ui/keyboard-and-palette](/run-kit/ui/keyboard-and-palette.md) § Command
Palette Actions) — SHALL render only when (a) the server has an operator window
(`role === "operator"` present in the sessions payload), (b) the subject window
carries a non-empty `chatSessionRef` (the template needs its JSONL transcript),
and (c) the subject is not itself the operator window (the pure
`canRequestWindowOperatorAction(win, hasOperator)` rule in
`row-flyout-card.tsx`, ONE predicate serving both actions). All
three facts already ride the sessions payload; an unavailable action is
OMITTED, never disabled. The window flyout card carries NO annotate row — the
`annotate-tab` verb is palette-only (the palette is the action registry of
record, Constitution V); the card keeps only the note DISPLAY line
(`NoteLine`). The fix-name and annotate client call is
`sendOperatorRequest(server, windowId, template)` (`api/client.ts` — the
`withServer` + `throwOnError` shape, so the structured 409/404 messages surface
as the thrown Error's message), fired once per click cycle behind the row's
in-flight guard; success toasts `"Sent to operator — tab will rename shortly"`
(fix-name) / `"Sent to operator — tab will be annotated shortly"` (annotate),
failure toasts the server's message. No spinner beyond the guard — the rename
or note arrives via the normal SSE derive tick.

The server-scoped half's client call is
`sendServerOperatorRequest(server, template, text, session?)` (`api/client.ts`
— the same `withServer` + `throwOnError` shape, posting `{template, text}` —
plus `session` only when the optional trailing argument is non-empty — to
`/api/operator-request`, so the structured 409/404 messages surface as the
thrown Error's message), driven by the shared `OperatorComposeDialog` and the
server-scoped palette entries
([ui/keyboard-and-palette](/run-kit/ui/keyboard-and-palette.md) § Command
Palette Actions) plus the pinned operator row's compose icon
([ui/sidebar](/run-kit/ui/sidebar.md) § Operator Pinned Row). The
`update-annotations` template has TWO fire surfaces: the palette's
`Operator: Update annotations` (server-wide — no `session` field — gated on
the same `hasOperatorWindow` omit-not-disable rule) and the session card's
`Update annotations` row (`session-row.tsx` — session-scoped, the `session`
field set to the card's session name, threaded as an optional
`onUpdateAnnotations` prop the way `onSpawnAgent` is and passed only when the
server has an operator window; the card is coarse-only, so the palette entry
is the keyboard/fine-pointer path). Both fire directly — no dialog, no
confirm — success toasting the hand-off
(`"Sent to operator — notes will be updated shortly"`), failure the server's
structured message; the notes arrive via the normal SSE derive tick (user-option
writes ride the ~12s safety poll), so there is no spinner beyond the in-flight
guard.

Both client helpers surface the busy outcome as a discriminated
`OperatorRequestResult` (`{outcome: "delivered"}` on `200 {"ok":true}` vs
`{outcome: "queued"}` on `202 {"queued":true}`), keeping the `withServer` +
`throwOnError` shape so structured 400/404/409 messages still surface as thrown
Error messages. Every operator-request call site resolves its success toast
through the shared `operatorRequestToast(result, deliveredCopy)` helper
(`lib/operator-request.ts`): the queued outcome toasts
`"Queued for operator — will be delivered when it is idle"` and the delivered
outcome keeps its existing copy. No new UI surface — no queue badge, no
inspect/cancel affordance (Constitution IV) — and no SSE payload change.

#### Scenario: Gating and single-flight
- **GIVEN** a window row on a server with an operator and a chat-carrying
  subject
- **WHEN** the flyout opens and "Fix tab name" is clicked
- **THEN** exactly one `sendOperatorRequest` fires (re-clicks during flight are
  no-ops) and a success toast appears.
- **AND GIVEN** no operator on the server, OR a subject without
  `chatSessionRef`, OR the operator's own row, **THEN** the row and the palette
  entry are absent (not disabled).
- **AND GIVEN** no operator on the server, **THEN** neither
  update-annotations fire surface renders (omitted, not disabled).
- **AND GIVEN** a busy operator and a tap on "Fix tab name", **WHEN** the
  request resolves queued, **THEN** the toast reads
  `"Queued for operator — will be delivered when it is idle"`; with an idle
  operator the delivered copy is unchanged.

## Design Decisions

### Dedicated `update-annotations` template instead of a brief-me fold
**Decision**: a dedicated server-scoped template writes/refreshes per-tab
`@rk_win_note` annotations; `brief-me` stays a read-only digest.
**Why**: folding note-writing into brief-me would change its digest contract
(read-only, reply-in-own-window) and be un-scopeable — brief-me has no session
parameter, and adding one for the fold's sake would widen two contracts at
once. A dedicated template gets its own palette entry and a session scope.
**Rejected**: appending "also write a @rk_win_note per tab" to `renderBriefMe`.
*Introduced by*: 260827-8n6k-update-annotations-tile-note

### Session scope as a declarative registry flag with consumer-side filtering
**Decision**: `acceptsSession` sits beside `acceptsText`; the handler filters
`buildServerOperatorFacts` output to the named session rather than
parameterising the builder.
**Why**: mirrors the closed-lane posture of `acceptsText` (undeclared ⇒ 400
before any fetch) and the "ordering lives in the consumer" precedent; the
shared builder keeps one shape for all templates.
**Rejected**: a `session` parameter on `buildServerOperatorFacts` (touches
every caller for one consumer).
*Introduced by*: 260827-8n6k-update-annotations-tile-note

### Actuation via raw tmux set-option, accepting the safety-poll repaint lag
**Decision**: the `color-tabs` prompt names `tmux set-option -t @N '@rk_win_color'
'<value>'` (and `-u` to unset) as the actuation, with the closed vocabularies
enumerated verbatim; the repaint arrives on the ~12s safety poll.
**Why**: matches every shipped template's actuation style (rename-window,
kill-window, rk riff, rk mux send); zero new failure modes (no daemon-URL
resolution, works for remote-host operators); the operation is a minutes-long
fire-and-forget batch, so a trailing ≤12s repaint is marginal. Invalid typed
values degrade harmlessly (`parseWindows` collapses unknown marker tokens and
normalizes stored flat marker tokens; color and flair are picker-reversible).
**Rejected**: instructing the operator to `curl POST
$(rk url)/api/windows/@N/options` (immediate repaint + validation, but a longer
fragile prompt introducing an operator→HTTP dependency no template has); a new
rk label verb (CLI-surface expansion for a cosmetic-latency win).
*Introduced by*: 260824-4940-operator-semantic-tab-coloring

### Label state rides the shared fact row
**Decision**: `Color`/`Marker`/`Flair` join `operatorWindowFact`, filled in the
one `buildServerOperatorFacts` pass; only `renderColorTabs` renders them (the
digest row writer deliberately ignores them).
**Why**: the digest-fields precedent below — one derivation site per
Constitution X; templates that don't need the fields ignore them.
**Rejected**: a color-tabs-only parallel facts struct (duplicates the
exclusion/iteration logic the shared builder owns).
*Introduced by*: 260824-4940-operator-semantic-tab-coloring

### Digest fields ride the shared fact row, not a parallel table
**Decision**: `operatorWindowFact` carries the digest-grade fields
(`AgentIdleDuration`, the `PrURL`-gated PR rollup, per-row `TranscriptPath`),
populated in the one `buildServerOperatorFacts` pass; one `TranscriptPath`
resolution per window fills both the routing-table row and the corpus, and
templates that don't need the new fields ignore them.
**Why**: one derivation site per Constitution X; a second server-facts struct
over the same FetchSessions pass would be the duplicated-logic anti-pattern.
**Rejected**: a separate `digestFacts` builder (duplicates the
exclusion/iteration/resolution logic the shared builder already owns).
*Introduced by*: 260822-rfz2-operator-digest-stuck-retire

### Waiting-first ordering lives in the digest render funcs
**Decision**: `renderBriefMe` (and `whats-stuck`'s filter) sort/filter a COPY
of `facts.Windows`; the shared builder keeps natural tmux order.
**Why**: the builder's order feeds other shipped templates and tests —
reordering shared state to serve one consumer risks silent output changes
there; sorting in the consumer is still server-side and deterministic.
**Rejected**: sorting in `buildServerOperatorFacts` (cross-template blast
radius for zero benefit).
*Introduced by*: 260822-rfz2-operator-digest-stuck-retire

### Zero-waiting rejection is a declarative registry flag
**Decision**: `requiresWaiting bool` on the entry, checked in
`handleServerOperatorRequest` after fact derivation; zero waiting rows ⇒ 409
`"nothing is waiting on this server"`.
**Why**: 409 is the seam's established valid-request-wrong-state class (busy
gate, probe failure) and the client already toasts structured 409s; the
declarative flag matches `requiresChatRef`/`acceptsText`.
**Rejected**: 404 (nothing is missing); 200 with a no-op delivery (wastes the
operator); an error-returning render signature (widens every entry's contract
for one template's precondition).
*Introduced by*: 260822-rfz2-operator-digest-stuck-retire

### Scope discriminator on the shared registry
**Decision**: one `operatorTemplates` registry with a `serverScoped bool` per
entry and two render seams (`render func(operatorFacts)` window-scoped,
`renderServer func(serverOperatorFacts)` server-scoped); each route 400s ids
of the other scope.
**Why**: the two template species need different fact shapes; a shared
registry keeps the allowlist posture in one place and the cross-scope 400
keeps each route's contract narrow.
**Rejected**: two separate registries (splits the allowlist, duplicates
lookup/validation); a single fact struct with nilable fields (renders can
silently read absent facts).
*Introduced by*: 260822-wyn3-operator-compose-spawn-search

### Dynamic fence length for client-text delimitation
**Decision**: the delimited block's backtick fence is computed as `max(3,
longest backtick run in the text + 1)`, under a treat-as-data framing line.
**Why**: a fixed triple-backtick fence is escapable by text containing one;
the dynamic fence makes early fence-close impossible by construction and is
trivially testable.
**Rejected**: rejecting text containing backticks (task descriptions
legitimately quote code); sentinel delimiters like `<<<TEXT>>>` (still
spoofable, and fences are the convention agents already parse).
*Introduced by*: 260822-wyn3-operator-compose-spawn-search

### One compose dialog, mode pre-selected per entry point
**Decision**: a single `OperatorComposeDialog` with a segmented spawn/find
control; the palette entries open it with their mode pre-selected, the pinned
operator row's compose icon opens it at the spawn default.
**Why**: one input surface to build and test; the segmented control satisfies
the row entry point's template choice without a second dialog.
**Rejected**: two separate dialogs (duplicate shells for a one-field surface);
submit-per-verb dual buttons (two primary actions in one dialog reads
ambiguous with Enter-submits).
*Introduced by*: 260822-wyn3-operator-compose-spawn-search

### Delivery + derive only — no persisted mailbox, no response channel
**Decision**: the actuation loop composes a templated prompt with pre-derived
facts and delivers it via the chat-send injection machinery; results come back
through the ordinary derive loop. There is no response channel, no protocol, no
reply parsing, no persisted mailbox, and no cross-restart retry. The one
pending-intent store is the in-memory per-server `operatorQueueTracker`
(`api/operator_queue.go`) — bounded (cap 8, TTL 30 min), process-memory only
(Constitution II), drained one entry per idle observation, forgotten on
restart. The shared injection engine's evidence-gated recovery is part of a
single delivery attempt.
**Why**: a persisted request queue or operator mailbox is durable state with
retry semantics (Constitution II rejects it); a response channel would turn the
operator into an RPC service and require reply parsing. The operator acts
through its shell and the result arrives through the derive loop rk already
runs — run-kit owns the derivable and deterministic; the operator owns judgment
over content (Constitution II/X). The in-memory queue preserves an explicit
user action across a busy window without crossing either line.
**Rejected**: a persisted request queue/mailbox (Constitution II); a response
channel or
reply protocol (RPC-ifies the operator); naive `send-keys` Enter injection
(known-flaky into agent TUIs — the chat-send machinery already solved
delivery).
*Introduced by*: 260822-fih1-operator-request-fix-tab-name

### In-process reuse of the chat-send injection path
**Decision**: the handler calls `s.injectChatMessage` +
`sessions.ResolveChatPane` directly (same `api` package) after its own single
`FetchSessions` pass.
**Why**: an HTTP self-call would re-enter the router for no isolation gain;
calling `resolveWindowChat` would issue a second `FetchSessions` per request.
One fetch serves subject lookup, operator lookup, fact derivation, AND the busy
gate.
**Rejected**: HTTP self-call (needless hop, loses the request context);
`resolveWindowChat` reuse (double fetch — the helper is window-scoped, this
handler is two-window).
*Introduced by*: 260822-fih1-operator-request-fix-tab-name

### Busy = `active` OR `waiting`; unknown proceeds
**Decision**: reject on `active`/`waiting`; deliver on `idle` or empty state.
**Why**: `waiting` means a human-blocking dialog is up — pasting into it is the
exact blind-typing hazard the probe exists for; empty state must pass or an
operator whose hooks haven't fired is permanently unreachable (the probe still
fail-closes delivery).
**Rejected**: idle-only (strands hookless operators); active-only-busy (types
into permission dialogs).
*Introduced by*: 260822-fih1-operator-request-fix-tab-name

### Optional `TranscriptLocator` capability, not an Adapter interface change
**Decision**: the transcript path is exposed as an optional interface the
claude adapter implements, reached via `Lookup` + type-assert behind the
package-level `chat.TranscriptPath`.
**Why**: the core `Adapter` interface stays provider-neutral (a future
protocol-based provider may have no on-disk transcript); the guard-bearing
`locateTranscript` stays the single path-resolution site.
**Rejected**: widening the `Adapter` interface (forces a meaningless method on
non-file providers); exporting `locateTranscript` bare (loses provider
routing).
*Introduced by*: 260822-fih1-operator-request-fix-tab-name

### Mirror waitingPushTracker rather than a new observer framework
**Decision**: the auto-name tracker is a sibling of `waitingPushTracker` — own
file, own mutex, clock + delivery func seams for tests, advanced synchronously
in the per-server tick, fan-out detached.
**Why**: the seam already exists, is Constitution-II-vetted ("no durable store
beyond the hub's episode map"), and its test pattern (pure decision function)
is proven.
**Rejected**: a generic transition-observer registry (speculative abstraction
for a second consumer); a separate polling goroutine (duplicate FetchSessions
cost, drift from the hub's snapshot).
*Introduced by*: 260822-q675-operator-auto-name-idle

### Delivery seam is an injected closure, not a hub→Server reference
**Decision**: the tracker holds a `deliver func(...)` seam (as
`waitingPushTracker` holds `notify`); the Server wires a closure over the
shared delivery core post-construction in `initSSEHub` (the `newSSEHub`
constructor can't see the Server — test hubs run with `deliver == nil`,
tracking still advancing, fan-out skipped).
**Why**: keeps the tracker pure/unit-testable and avoids a hub→Server cycle;
identical to the waiting-push `notify` seam.
**Rejected**: calling `s.injectChatMessage` directly from the tracker (couples
tracker tests to the injection engine).
*Introduced by*: 260822-q675-operator-auto-name-idle

### Level-triggered drain condition
**Decision**: the operator-request queue drains when (operator idle ∧ queue
non-empty ∧ per-server min-gap elapsed), evaluated fresh each tick — not on the
busy→idle edge.
**Why**: edge-triggering strands entries whenever the edge is missed (a first
observation is not a transition; the operator can flip idle between ticks); the
level condition self-heals every missed edge at zero extra cost.
**Rejected**: reusing `autoNameTracker`'s transition detection for the drain
trigger.

### Busy race does not consume the entry
**Decision**: the busy-class `operatorReject` at drain requeues the entry (head
position, min-gap already stamped); a drain-time `FetchSessions` error
requeues the same way; every other delivery failure drops it.
**Why**: on a busy rejection nothing was typed, so redelivery is provably safe;
dropping on a mere snapshot race would contradict the level-trigger's
self-healing purpose. Real injection failures are ambiguous (text may sit in
the composer) — retrying risks double-paste.
**Rejected**: uniform drop on any failure; uniform retry with a counter.

### Queue the request, render at drain
**Decision**: queue entries carry `{template, windowID, text, session,
enqueuedAt}`; facts re-derive and the prompt re-renders at drain from a fresh
sessions fetch inside the detached worker.
**Why**: fact tables (agent states, PR rollups, transcript paths) go stale in
minutes; a queued prompt would deliver stale facts as instructions.
**Rejected**: queueing the rendered prompt string.
