/**
 * Main process — lifecycle, the multi-window BrowserWindow registry, per-
 * (window, host) WebContentsViews, security wiring, IPC, the welcome ↔
 * host-view routing, and local-daemon control. ("Host" = an rk instance;
 * "server" is reserved for tmux servers. The `servers:*` IPC channels and
 * the bridge's `servers` group keep their names — they are the web SPA's
 * contract.)
 *
 * ONE PROCESS, MANY WINDOWS: `requestSingleInstanceLock` keeps userData
 * single-owner (a lock-less launch quits; `second-instance` opens a new
 * window HERE), and a window registry replaces the v1 single `mainWindow`.
 * Host content renders in ONE PERSISTENT WebContentsView PER (WINDOW, HOST)
 * pair (created lazily, kept alive until the host is removed or the window
 * is torn down), so a host switch is an instant detach/attach flip that
 * preserves live renderer state — WS/SSE connections, xterm scrollback,
 * scroll position — never a reload. The same host may show in N windows,
 * each an independent view; views never migrate between windows. Each
 * window's own webContents serves only the welcome page. Per-view decision
 * logic + badge/theme caches: ./views (electron-free, node:test covered);
 * window decisions (duplication targets, titles, restore): ./window-registry;
 * the cold-start window-set store: ./windows (windows.json).
 *
 * Web-tile GUEST views (the SPA's native-engine web tabs) are per-(window,
 * host, tabKey) WebContentsViews attached as SIBLINGS of the host view on the
 * window's contentView (a child of the host view never paints — Electron
 * 43/Linux), in a dedicated hardened partition with NO preload. Their
 * registry (./web-views, electron-free, node:test covered) is the z-order
 * authority: addChildView(host) raises the host above its guests, so the
 * attach seam re-raises the incoming host's guests and the detach seam hides
 * the outgoing host's. The `web:*` IPC surface — create/destroy/bounds/
 * visible/load/reload plus the parity channels back/forward/find/stop-find/
 * zoom/chords/devtools and the per-host mode query — is gated on a
 * registered-host sender that owns a
 * host view, plus tabKey membership under that sender. Every guest event
 * relays to the owning host webContents on the single `web:event` channel
 * (title/favicon/loading/failed/url+httpStatus/focus/find/chord/zoom). Chord
 * reclaim runs through `before-input-event` matched against the per-guest
 * SPA-uploaded table (pure matcher in ./chords, electron-free, node:test
 * covered): a match is preventDefaulted, hops focus to the host webContents,
 * and relays `chord` for the SPA to re-dispatch.
 *
 * This shell is a VIEWER (Constitution VI): it loads an existing `rk serve`
 * URL and NEVER spawns or supervises the rk daemon on its own initiative.
 * child_process is used ONLY for explicit user-initiated actions — `rk daemon`
 * start/stop/restart via the welcome card or the Daemon menu, and
 * `rk desktop update` via the App menu's Restart-to-Update click — and
 * read-only detection (`rk url`, `rk --version`, `rk desktop status`). There
 * is no auto-start and no auto-update anywhere; the tmux/server layer stays
 * independent of this process, and the CLI (not the shell) is the updater.
 *
 * Dev override: `RK_DESKTOP_URL=http://localhost:3000 just dev-desktop`
 * loads that URL directly without persisting it to hosts.json (or
 * windows.json — sentinel windows are never persisted).
