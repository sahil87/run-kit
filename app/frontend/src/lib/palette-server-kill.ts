/**
 * Pure builder for the command-palette per-server kill actions
 * (`Server: Kill <name>`, the current server suffixed ` (current)`). Follows
 * the lib/palette-pin.ts / lib/palette-move.ts pattern (pure, dependency-free,
 * unit-testable) so the enumeration and label composition are verifiable
 * without mounting the whole shell. The action body is a thin `onKill(name)`
 * callback passed in by the caller (app.tsx wires it to `setKillServerTarget`,
 * funnelling every entry through the existing inline confirm Dialog — incl.
 * its DAEMON_SERVER warning — and `executeKillServer`).
 *
 * This supersedes the single current-server `kill-server` action: with the
 * hover kill ✕ removed from the SERVER-panel tiles (bylc), the palette listing
 * is the keyboard escape hatch that keeps EVERY server killable — including
 * non-current servers, which have no SESSIONS-pane group header under the
 * `current` scope mode (Constitution V).
